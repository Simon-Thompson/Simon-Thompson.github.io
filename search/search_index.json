What follows is an old man, shakes fist at the sky rant about how ARPGs nowadays miss the point and the older games were better. In my time on this earth, I've played a handful of Diablo-like games: Diablo 2, 3 and 4, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Last Epoch. I've even enjoyed loosely related games like Borderlands, Vampire Survivors, heck even Hades can be considered an ARPG. It's a genre I really love for three reasons: the in-depth build-making that feels like fine-tuning an engine while you play, the looting of unique items that completely change your game plan, and the satisfying progression of mowing down of hordes of monsters in fast-paced gameplay. Unfortunately for me, not all is sunshine and roses in ARPG-land. My favorite game in the genre remains Diablo 2, because of all the games I've played, none has come as close to the ideal ARPG as the one that set the standard at the turn of the millennium. In fact, modern iterations on the genre have strayed further and further from what made the original good in favor of \"catering to what people want\", which is games-as-a-service endless seasonal grind. It's in direct opposition of what I love most about these games, the journey of making a build that works and tinkering to make it better. Before I dive headlong into each ARPG I've played, let's talk about some general points related to most if not all of them. In General Campaign vs. Endgame The core of my gripe against modern ARPGs, they all focus entirely on the \"endgame\", which is a cancerous growth of infinite game mechanics subsuming the campaign. It's also what every player in every community will call the REAL game, and if you've only invested 30 hours in the campaign you haven't seen the REAL game. I have 217 hours in Path of Exile, but I guess I've really never played the game cuz I never made it past tier 4 maps (and all mapping represents 1% of my playtime). If only I'd played the REAL game and grinded the RIGHT systems, I'd be enjoying myself instead of whatever fake happiness I felt playing the campaign. The majority, in fact the entirety of online discourse revolves around the endgame. Around the best items, the most godlike builds, the fastest Uber clear times, tier 17 map farming, and everything that the average player will never see in their lifetime. J1mmy said it best while talking about World of Warcraft. The Community All those Youtube videos titled \"Ultimate Maven farming build | shroud Necro 300% AS\" have a viewership that'll nod along like \"this build looks great\", even though 99% of those viewers will never even see the boots the build is using, let alone reach the Maven. It's almost a voyeur's hobby, of looking at these insane builds and dreaming about how cool it would be to have it yourself, disregarding the 1000 hours of playtime on one character in one season that would require. It gives a dream to chase after, and that's ok. What's not ok is that every. freakin. guide. is like this. When everybody's dreaming, where's the truth? Picture this: you find a guide for a cool build, and the guide says \"getting this build online takes medium effort\". What's medium effort? Could be 200 hours of grinding, or maybe it's 10 hours of grinding. There's no sense of scale, and few touchstones to compare the build to without already being so deep in the sauce you've probably already grinded 200 hours. But you know what grinds my gears more than anything. Every freakin' guide for a cool build, every single one, has a one-line disclaimer somewhere in the intro that says \"This build comes online at level 60. Use earthshatter to level efficiently\". Do I have to describe everything wrong with this statement? Yes, yes I do. Even for the most experienced grinder and altaholic using all the twink gear in the game (twink gear being rare/high-level drops that can be used by lvl 1 characters and make leveling much smoother), clearing the campaign will take you easily 8 hours. For most players who aren't tweaking on cocaine while they play, it's more like 15 to 30 hours. So what that statement is saying is, don't play this cool build until you've played 15 to 30 hours of the most cookie-cutter, mind-numbing build you can imagine, then you can play this build. On top of that, you can invest all that time only to find out you don't like the build! If you follow these guides as written, you won't even touch the build until the end of the campaign, or far into the endgame. I've personally had to find out the hard way (twice cuz I'm an idiot) that sometimes the builds just feel janky to play despite how cool they look. In a game like PoE where respeccing costs valuable, limited resources, that means you're basically borked and it's time to scrap and restart. Perhaps most insidious of all, however, is the fact that this statement, and this situation, is a product of the dev's design choices. These builds only exist in the endgame because the items and the skills needed to enable them only exist in the endgame. There's no low or mid level, sorta-good items that can kinda make it work and would allow you to level with the build. It's all or nothing, and as such, the community reacts by creating build guides revolving around leveling the most efficient way till you can play the fun lategame builds. It's a real shame, and it reflects There are some blessed \"dad-friendly\" build guides out there, and I praise their efforts, but they are literally one in a thousand. Their channels are often hard to find, as they aren't linked to from the icyveins and maxrolls of this world. The Complexity It's so easy to bash on Path of Exile for this, but honestly every ARPG does it to an extent that's unhealthy: the endgame cancerous growth and endless cycle of updates creates an unpenetrable miasma of game terminology and systems that requires an essay complete with pictures in order to begin to grasp it. Let's illustrate this with an example from PoE : In the endgame you can engage in mapping, bossing, heisting, labyrinths, delving, synthesis, simulacrum, blight, uber blight, betrayal, sanctum, bestiary, kirac missions, crafting, trading, incursions and of course the league mechanics (delirium, legion, harvest, abyss, expedition, ritual, settlers, ultimatum, harbinger, affliction, beyond, domination, anarchy, sentinel, tormented spirits, mercenaries, essenzen, whatever). Any one of these systems requires either a PhD, an essay-length guide, or 10s of hours of playtime to really start learning it. Mapping should be the beginner-friendly, entry point system that all Path of Exile players must interact with. Maps go from tier 1 to 17, but there's also white/yellow/red maps which are the same things as tiers but kinda tiers of tiers for some reason. You get red maps by corrupting and alching regular maps, and you'll need yellow then red maps in order to progress past the first few tiers so you can get the 4 voidstones and do the Maven invitations so you can do the tenbossinvitationssoyoucangetyour5thmapslotandthenkilltheEater,ExarchandUberElderanddontforgettodoyour4thlabsomewherearoundT6mapsanddidImentionyoushouldkillBlackStarandInfiniteHungerAnywaysbynowyoushouldbereadyfortier16mapssogrindmoregearyou'vebeengrindingrightthebasechanceforshapermapsislike3%sogetyourbigboypantsoncuzyoullneed4ofthoseatleastsoyoucanrepeatedlygrindtheshaperforhalftheuberelderfragmentsyouneedthendoitagainwiththeelder-waitIhaventtalkedaboutsynthesismapsyetsoyoucanfight\u1d65\u2091\u2099\u2090\u1d63\u1d62\u1d64\u209b\u2092\u1d63\u209c\u2095\u2091\u1d66\u1d63\u2091\u2090\ud835\udcb8\u2095\u2097\u2092\u1d63\ud835\udcb9\u209b... Or, consult this handy-dandy chart . \"But Simon\" you plead, \"Path of Exile is the most complicated game in the genre! Surely this is a strawman argument you thought up in a fever dream.\" Good eye reader, and I won't let your nasally complaint distract me from my crusade. Instead, let's turn our attention to Diablo 4, often ridiculed for its braindead simplicity, among other things. Here's a screenshot of an excel table of the resources you'll need to farm and where to farm them. That should tell you all you need to know. Now remember, for all intents and purposes, the endgame is the game. All these systems and mechanics are what you're meant to interact with, not that measly abortion of a campaign. As the playerbase'll tell you, having all these mechanics is a good thing, right? Well, normally I'd say yes, agree with you that more content is a Good Thing\u2122 and we'd all move on. Unfortunately, ARPG devs are allergic to tutorials or really any kind of guidance. Instead you get \"here's the endgame, try maps, have fun!\" and are thrown in the deep end. So you either drop out before you start or turn to the online community and get sucked in to their top leveling builds, efficient map fragment routes and max rune farming spots. Before long you're another cog in the machine. Let's move on to look at the games, but before we do, a tierlist: Diablo 2 Ahhh my sweet baby, you who can do no wrong. No rose-tinted glasses here, I played the Diablo 2 remaster in 2023 and what I found was an endlessly replayable, lean, mean campaign complete with a roster of unique characters. Being an old-ass game, there weren't any cool combat mechanics outside of move and hit, but damn if they didn't make that satisfying. The movespeed is just right, starting you off a bit slow and speeding you up considerably as you accumulate levels and items. The bosses are cool and easy to farm. The enemies are just dangerous enough. The maps are big but not too big, and their environments and music hit just right. Heck, you just have to look at how the campaign is designed to be played 3 times on Normal, Nightmare and Hell to know that the devs designed the game to be replayable, and replayable it is. There's no bloated cutscenes, fetch quests or boring animations to slow you down here. Everything is action and zooming around maps right from the get-go. They even added a sprinkle (note: a SPRINKLE) of endgame in the form of Ubers for those players thirsty for more, though replaying the campaign endlessly on different builds is satisfying enough for most players, especially since Hell difficulty is actually hard and requires the right amount of prep. My one gripe with the game is the drop rate of loot: it's ridiculously low. Grinding is one thing, but you can run the same boss 1000 times without seeing an item. This isn't hyperbole, there's youtube vids of Diablo 2 boss farming marathons that show just that. I even played one run with a mod increasing drop rates by 100x, and guess what, I got a few interesting uniques but honestly not much. I understand that the extreme rarity of these items makes every drop feel super important, I really do. And it promotes trade between players and fosters a sense of community (ignoring trading sites). But the game could use a solo self-found mode with drop rates adjusted for the guy who doesn't want to run the same boss 3000 times. Other than this one gripe, Diablo 2 remains my baby. The poster child for a good ARPG. Easy to get into, doesn't break up the action, focuses on a replayable campaign, tons of builds and cool stories. Diablo 3 The black sheep of the series, Diablo 3 shed the gritty grimdark grime of D2 for a WoW-esque cartoony aesthetic, with gameplay to match. This shift was too much for a lot of players, who took to message boards to complain loudly for years. However, in my humble opinion, it was D3's saving grace. Certainly, the progression systems, the campaign's pacing, and shudder the endgame were already well on the way to becoming the horror that is Diablo 4. So if the gameplay and the tone was the same as D2, the comparison between the two would've been stark and unforgiving for this younger sibling. At least this way, Diablo 3 stood its own ground and created a game that's fun to play. (Editor's note: I'm talking about post-Reaper of Souls D3, not launch day D3 which I did play and was pretty meh). Most notably, it actually has cool items you can pick up during the campaign that change your playstyle. Wow! What a novel concept! I sure hope those Blizzard devs bring good ideas like that into their next game. Grim Dawn Ah Grim Dawn, my sweet summer child. Here's a game released in the vicinity of this decade that sticks to Diablo 2's idea of a replayable campaign, eschewing the horror of the endgame monstrosity for clean, simple fun. On top of that it has cool skills, varied builds and strong class identity. Its setting and campaign pacing are a bit weaker than D2's, but otherwise it's the game that flew closest to the sun. So why do I rank it equal to Path of Exile, a game I have a hundred complaints about? One reason: Grim Dawn does not avoid the cursed crafting subsystem. I try to ignore these in every game I play, but in this one it's required to progress in Hell difficulty. You have to grind a pyramid of resources so that you can craft a ribbon to put on your pants that gives you the resistance stats you need to not get oneshot by spiders at the start of Act 1 Hell. And that sucks. Honestly if the grind was for better gear , especially gear that drops from bosses on Nightmare, I'd have been willing to do it. But an obscure, boring, completely artificial crafting system that requires you to load up a wiki guide to complete 27 steps for each component made me nope right out. I ended up modding the components into my game, that's how little I wanted to do it. It was more fun to look up how to mod a .ini file using a 3rd party software than it was to actually play the game. Path of Exile PoE is called by fans the epitome of the modern ARPG, and for me it is the epitome of everything wrong with the genre. It boasts a skill system that's so vast memes are made about it. You can make dozens of builds, each viable enough to engage with the game's endgame content in differing ways. Raining firestorms and meteorites? Easy, it's got that. Summon totems that cast those same firestorms? It's got that. 10,000hp and piles of armor? It's got that. 1hp but tons of shields? You bet it's got that. Though to go against my point, sometimes simple builds I really wanted to play, like guy who attacks fast with axes or thief dual wielding daggers or bow lady that shoots lots of arrows, were so niche as to be kinda bad or required items that were so prohibitively expensive/rare as to be unplayable. In a strange quirk of the massive build viability, weird and non-archetypal builds have taken the forefront of the meta, leaving regular ol' playstyles in the dust. For the most part, anyways. As with Grim Dawn, PoE suffers from over-complicated-itis. Anyone who's played it can tell you there's a big learning curve, sure. I don't mind tackling systems like armor vs. evasion vs. energy shield; block chance vs. spell suppression; mana reservation and cast-on-x modifiers. I'm even ok with crafting, even if it isn't my jam. But then you get unique jewels that add esoteric, unknowable effects, e.g. Lethal Pride jewel: \"Commanded leadership over (10000-18000) warriors under (Akoya-Kaom-Rakiata). Passives in the radius are conquered by the karui. Historic.\" That's it. That's the whole description. A real Ring of Gwanja moment. PoE also commits the cardinal sin of making uniques trash. By the dev's own design, uniques are meant to provide build-enabling effects, but aren't supposed to be better than rares. In fact, they're plain worse in every way. No unique acquirable in the campaign is worth anything, you'll need to be lvl 60+ before you start seeing drops worth a damn and even then, best you can do is trade them to other players for pennies. To put in into perspective, glass baubles you need five of in order to upgrade your life flask are worth ten times more than 99% of uniques you'll find. To add insult to injury, the game does the big sound effect and cool VFX when a unique drops, which would get you excited if you didn't know it's worthless before even looking at it. The final nail in the coffin is that like in Grim Dawn, uniques don't drop from bosses (before some endgame map bosses that 95% of players won't see anyways). They drop from any mob in the world, removing the fun of target farming a boss for their uniques while leveling your character. About those bosses that 95% of players won't see, what's up with that? It's like these devs saw Diablo 2 make Uber bosses as this super-late-game milestone for the most invested players and thought \"hey what if we do that, but instead of making the Ubers juiced-up variants of regular bosses, we just put all the cool bosses at the end of an endless treadmill!\" Great idea devs. I'm very confident when I say the majority of PoE players haven't even smelled a whiff of the Uber Elder. Last Epoch Finally a breath of fresh air, though really it's a slightly less rancid breath of sewer air that's comparatively fresher after being submerged in filthy water for days. Last Epoch's team of indie devs aimed to strike a balance between modern Diablo's simplicity and Path of Exile's complexity, and they achieved their goal. The only problem is that in the process they adopted the same modern approach as PoE and D4, with a treadmill endgame experience. In its favour, most builds are playable during the campaign, and the devs implemented a great solo self-found system that can increase loot drops up to 200% and let you target farm pieces. It's a shining example of learning from your betters, and if it weren't for a lack of content (the campaign's only ~70% done) and some jankiness stemming from inexperienced devs, I'd rank it higher than PoE. Diablo 4 Look where all these poor design decisions have brought us. How low you've fallen from your peak, how tortuously the trade-off of enjoyment for engagement has wounded you little by little until you can barely stand under the weight of your mistakes. Look how they massacred my boy. (And I still gave it a 7/10 instead of the 4/10 it deserved because I like killing monsters that much.) Conclusion I dream of the ideal ARPG, one with dozens if not hundreds of uniques that enable hundreds more builds, dropping at every range of rarity known to man. One which treats grinding as part of the game, as so creates purposeful, enjoyable gameplay loops around it. One that rewards time invested with amazing horizontal progression. One that doesn't balance around only the most terminally online players, instead making space for casuals and busy dad schedules. One that offers all kinds of sick looking gear not blocked behind a cash shop, and finally one that holds secrets waiting for explorers to find them without needing a PhD in statistics and branching logic. I don't expect the formula to change, as clearly it makes money and attracts and keeps players invested. And so, I will continue feeling an agonizing mixture of love and despair towards this genre that's so fun yet bloated by the cancerous growth of greed. Hey, maybe Titan Quest 2 will be better, there's always hopium.","title":"ARPG Manifesto"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#arpg-manifesto","text":"ARPG, or action role-playing game, are isometric hack-n-slash looters like the Diablo series.

As the playerbase'll tell you, having all these mechanics is a good thing, right? Well, normally I'd say yes, agree with you that more content is a Good Thing\u2122 and we'd all move on. Unfortunately, ARPG devs are allergic to tutorials or really any kind of guidance. Instead you get \"here's the endgame, try maps, have fun!\" and are thrown in the deep end. So you either drop out before you start or turn to the online community and get sucked in to their top leveling builds, efficient map fragment routes and max rune farming spots. Before long you're another cog in the machine. Let's move on to look at the games, but before we do, a tierlist:","title":"The Complexity"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#diablo-2","text":"Ahhh my sweet baby, you who can do no wrong. No rose-tinted glasses here, I played the Diablo 2 remaster in 2023 and what I found was an endlessly replayable, lean, mean campaign complete with a roster of unique characters. Being an old-ass game, there weren't any cool combat mechanics outside of move and hit, but damn if they didn't make that satisfying. The movespeed is just right, starting you off a bit slow and speeding you up considerably as you accumulate levels and items. The bosses are cool and easy to farm. The enemies are just dangerous enough. The maps are big but not too big, and their environments and music hit just right. Heck, you just have to look at how the campaign is designed to be played 3 times on Normal, Nightmare and Hell to know that the devs designed the game to be replayable, and replayable it is. There's no bloated cutscenes, fetch quests or boring animations to slow you down here. Everything is action and zooming around maps right from the get-go. They even added a sprinkle (note: a SPRINKLE) of endgame in the form of Ubers for those players thirsty for more, though replaying the campaign endlessly on different builds is satisfying enough for most players, especially since Hell difficulty is actually hard and requires the right amount of prep. My one gripe with the game is the drop rate of loot: it's ridiculously low. Grinding is one thing, but you can run the same boss 1000 times without seeing an item. This isn't hyperbole, there's youtube vids of Diablo 2 boss farming marathons that show just that. I even played one run with a mod increasing drop rates by 100x, and guess what, I got a few interesting uniques but honestly not much. I understand that the extreme rarity of these items makes every drop feel super important, I really do. And it promotes trade between players and fosters a sense of community (ignoring trading sites). But the game could use a solo self-found mode with drop rates adjusted for the guy who doesn't want to run the same boss 3000 times. Other than this one gripe, Diablo 2 remains my baby. The poster child for a good ARPG. Easy to get into, doesn't break up the action, focuses on a replayable campaign, tons of builds and cool stories.","title":"Diablo 2"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#diablo-3","text":"The black sheep of the series, Diablo 3 shed the gritty grimdark grime of D2 for a WoW-esque cartoony aesthetic, with gameplay to match. This shift was too much for a lot of players, who took to message boards to complain loudly for years. However, in my humble opinion, it was D3's saving grace. Certainly, the progression systems, the campaign's pacing, and shudder the endgame were already well on the way to becoming the horror that is Diablo 4. So if the gameplay and the tone was the same as D2, the comparison between the two would've been stark and unforgiving for this younger sibling. At least this way, Diablo 3 stood its own ground and created a game that's fun to play. (Editor's note: I'm talking about post-Reaper of Souls D3, not launch day D3 which I did play and was pretty meh). Most notably, it actually has cool items you can pick up during the campaign that change your playstyle. Wow! What a novel concept! I sure hope those Blizzard devs bring good ideas like that into their next game.","title":"Diablo 3"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#grim-dawn","text":"Ah Grim Dawn, my sweet summer child. Here's a game released in the vicinity of this decade that sticks to Diablo 2's idea of a replayable campaign, eschewing the horror of the endgame monstrosity for clean, simple fun. On top of that it has cool skills, varied builds and strong class identity. Its setting and campaign pacing are a bit weaker than D2's, but otherwise it's the game that flew closest to the sun. So why do I rank it equal to Path of Exile, a game I have a hundred complaints about? One reason: Grim Dawn does not avoid the cursed crafting subsystem. I try to ignore these in every game I play, but in this one it's required to progress in Hell difficulty. You have to grind a pyramid of resources so that you can craft a ribbon to put on your pants that gives you the resistance stats you need to not get oneshot by spiders at the start of Act 1 Hell. And that sucks. Honestly if the grind was for better gear , especially gear that drops from bosses on Nightmare, I'd have been willing to do it. But an obscure, boring, completely artificial crafting system that requires you to load up a wiki guide to complete 27 steps for each component made me nope right out. I ended up modding the components into my game, that's how little I wanted to do it. It was more fun to look up how to mod a .ini file using a 3rd party software than it was to actually play the game.","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#path-of-exile","text":"PoE is called by fans the epitome of the modern ARPG, and for me it is the epitome of everything wrong with the genre. It boasts a skill system that's so vast memes are made about it. You can make dozens of builds, each viable enough to engage with the game's endgame content in differing ways. Raining firestorms and meteorites? Easy, it's got that. Summon totems that cast those same firestorms? It's got that. 10,000hp and piles of armor? It's got that. 1hp but tons of shields? You bet it's got that. Though to go against my point, sometimes simple builds I really wanted to play, like guy who attacks fast with axes or thief dual wielding daggers or bow lady that shoots lots of arrows, were so niche as to be kinda bad or required items that were so prohibitively expensive/rare as to be unplayable. In a strange quirk of the massive build viability, weird and non-archetypal builds have taken the forefront of the meta, leaving regular ol' playstyles in the dust. For the most part, anyways. As with Grim Dawn, PoE suffers from over-complicated-itis. Anyone who's played it can tell you there's a big learning curve, sure. I don't mind tackling systems like armor vs. evasion vs. energy shield; block chance vs. spell suppression; mana reservation and cast-on-x modifiers. I'm even ok with crafting, even if it isn't my jam. But then you get unique jewels that add esoteric, unknowable effects, e.g. Lethal Pride jewel: \"Commanded leadership over (10000-18000) warriors under (Akoya-Kaom-Rakiata). Passives in the radius are conquered by the karui. Historic.\" That's it. That's the whole description. A real Ring of Gwanja moment. PoE also commits the cardinal sin of making uniques trash. By the dev's own design, uniques are meant to provide build-enabling effects, but aren't supposed to be better than rares. In fact, they're plain worse in every way. No unique acquirable in the campaign is worth anything, you'll need to be lvl 60+ before you start seeing drops worth a damn and even then, best you can do is trade them to other players for pennies. To put in into perspective, glass baubles you need five of in order to upgrade your life flask are worth ten times more than 99% of uniques you'll find. To add insult to injury, the game does the big sound effect and cool VFX when a unique drops, which would get you excited if you didn't know it's worthless before even looking at it. The final nail in the coffin is that like in Grim Dawn, uniques don't drop from bosses (before some endgame map bosses that 95% of players won't see anyways). They drop from any mob in the world, removing the fun of target farming a boss for their uniques while leveling your character. About those bosses that 95% of players won't see, what's up with that? It's like these devs saw Diablo 2 make Uber bosses as this super-late-game milestone for the most invested players and thought \"hey what if we do that, but instead of making the Ubers juiced-up variants of regular bosses, we just put all the cool bosses at the end of an endless treadmill!\" Great idea devs. I'm very confident when I say the majority of PoE players haven't even smelled a whiff of the Uber Elder.","title":"Path of Exile"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#last-epoch","text":"Finally a breath of fresh air, though really it's a slightly less rancid breath of sewer air that's comparatively fresher after being submerged in filthy water for days. Last Epoch's team of indie devs aimed to strike a balance between modern Diablo's simplicity and Path of Exile's complexity, and they achieved their goal. The only problem is that in the process they adopted the same modern approach as PoE and D4, with a treadmill endgame experience. In its favour, most builds are playable during the campaign, and the devs implemented a great solo self-found system that can increase loot drops up to 200% and let you target farm pieces. It's a shining example of learning from your betters, and if it weren't for a lack of content (the campaign's only ~70% done) and some jankiness stemming from inexperienced devs, I'd rank it higher than PoE.","title":"Last Epoch"},{"location":"arpg-manifesto/#diablo-4","text":"Look where all these poor design decisions have brought us.

One which treats grinding as part of the game, as so creates purposeful, enjoyable gameplay loops around it. One that rewards time invested with amazing horizontal progression. One that doesn't balance around only the most terminally online players, instead making space for casuals and busy dad schedules. One that offers all kinds of sick looking gear not blocked behind a cash shop, and finally one that holds secrets waiting for explorers to find them without needing a PhD in statistics and branching logic. I don't expect the formula to change, as clearly it makes money and attracts and keeps players invested. And so, I will continue feeling an agonizing mixture of love and despair towards this genre that's so fun yet bloated by the cancerous growth of greed. Hey, maybe Titan Quest 2 will be better, there's always hopium.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"scores/","text":"Ranked By Score 10 Vampire Survivors Hi Fi Rush Return of the Obra Dinn Slay the Princess 9.5 Divinity: Original Sin 2 Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines Yakuza: Like a Dragon Case of the Golden Idol Elden Ring 9 Disco Elysium Devil May Cry 5 Dredge Day of the Tentacle Slay the Spire 8.5 Diablo 2: Resurrected WH40K: Dawn of War Balatro Star of Providence 8 Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Heat Signature Baldur's Gate 2 Terraria World of Horror Alan Wake Against the Storm 7.5 Subnautica: Below Zero Path of Exile DragonFable Grim Dawn 7 Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Spec Ops: The Line Cookie Clicker Diablo 4","title":"Ranked by Score"},{"location":"scores/#ranked-by-score","text":"","title":"Ranked By Score"},{"location":"scores/#10","text":"Vampire Survivors Hi Fi Rush Return of the Obra Dinn Slay the Princess","title":"10"},{"location":"scores/#95","text":"Divinity: Original Sin 2 Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines Yakuza: Like a Dragon Case of the Golden Idol Elden Ring","title":"9.5"},{"location":"scores/#9","text":"Disco Elysium Devil May Cry 5 Dredge Day of the Tentacle Slay the Spire","title":"9"},{"location":"scores/#85","text":"Diablo 2: Resurrected WH40K: Dawn of War Balatro Star of Providence","title":"8.5"},{"location":"scores/#8","text":"Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Heat Signature Baldur's Gate 2 Terraria World of Horror Alan Wake Against the Storm","title":"8"},{"location":"scores/#75","text":"Subnautica: Below Zero Path of Exile DragonFable Grim Dawn","title":"7.5"},{"location":"scores/#7","text":"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Spec Ops: The Line Cookie Clicker Diablo 4","title":"7"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/","text":"Against the Storm Score: 8/10 Playtime: 15 hours Against the Storm is a city-building management game with roguelike mechanics.

You'd think so, although the devs squeezed as much complexity and rich mechanics into those two bars as they could. The red bar generally fills over time, although the cycle of seasons and various debuffs that come with the repeating storm can cause it to rise quickly, as well as random events from discovering new territory. The blue bar can be filled in a panoply of ways, including keeping your villagers happy, fulfilling quest objectives, as rewards for trade or clearing events. There's no combat in this game. It very much is a management game, where your interaction amounts to placing buildings, ordering your villagers to man differing stations, and balancing numbers in menus. You can pause the game at any time, or make it go at x3 speed. Despite all this, the game feels fast-paced, your efforts a constant push against the ticking clock of the red bar as you perform what feels like a circus balancing act of 10 stacked plates at once, never letting any fall for fear of everything unraveling towards your settlement's doom. I feel like it's this balancing act that makes the game feel impenetrable to me.

The sound design and music are both top-notch, and the OST is worth a relisten on youtube.

I respect the game's abundance of mechanical choices, as well as its cool fantasy vibe and great soundtrack. Due to my salty lack of personal enjoyment, I dock 2 points from my final score, and as such give Against the Storm an 8/10.

Gameplay. The one sour note to an otherwise captivating game has got to be the gameplay. Don't get me wrong, the core mechanic of pointing your flashlight at enemies until they lose their shadow armor then blasting them away works decently well, but the sheer repetition of enemy encounters made it feel like a slog by even the early levels. There's variety in enemy types, the devs even bringing in cranes, a tractor, and random barrels to attack you, but no matter what the challenge is, the answer is always: point flashlight, then optionally shoot. Replaying the game on its hardest difficulty only exacerbated these issues, making fights longer and with more enemies and showing the weakness of their AI as you can often run past encounters while stutter-stunning them with the flashlight. Actually, skipping encounters was more fun than fighting them as it brought a sense of \"I gotta hold these guys back while I run away to the next light\", versus the usual back away slowly while shining the flashlight at one, then another enemy. There is some weapon variety to alleviate these woes, with the shotgun and flare gun carrying my playthrough when I was forced to fight. Spookyness. The game rarely tries to scare you, only occasionally using a mild old lady jumpscare, relying instead on the upkeep of an unsettling tension that ebbs and flows as you must fight your way through the night in each episode. This is really the level of horror I'm most comfortable with: not so spooky that you can only play in short, high-tension bursts like Resident Evil but just spooky enough to give you that morbid glance into the unknown that I like so much. Worldbuilding. For fans of Control , you'll be familiar with developer Remedy Entertainment's strong use of background worldbuilding in the form of audio logs, notes lying around and optional dialogue you can hear by sticking around an NPC before rushing to the next part. I loved the Twilight Zone -esque Night Springs shorts that you could find on TVs, as well as the charming character of Bright Falls, Washington that reminds me a lot of Twin Peaks . The game also makes plenty of references to the works of Stephen King, Alfred Hitchcock and H.P. Lovecraft. Story. Can't talk about Alan Wake without talking about the story. You play as a grumpy writer fleeing the big city in order to overcome his writer's block. After some supernatural incidents, you're left with a bad case of amnesia, a missing week, and pages of a manuscript you can't remember writing that seem to be coming true. You have to contend with an evil darkness that threatens to overtake you and the poor people of Bright Falls, while desperately searching for answers and avoiding the authorities yourself. While the start can be quite confusing, using in media res and a lightly scrambled timeline of events that leaves you scratching your head, the story does a good job of explaining what happened and reveals all by the end. The triple threat of Alan's ongoing inner monologue, his manuscript pages and sporadic haunted TVs that show you your missing past does an excellent job of foreshadowing and hinting at what's really happening until you finally get there. Supporting characters are solid, bringing a breath of fresh air between long bouts of monster slaying and running around. Special shoutout to Barry Wheeler, Alan's agent and best friend who was hilarious but sadly won't be in the second game. Format. The game uses an unusual format, each section framed as an episode (or the chapter of a book), complete with a music video outro and \"Previously on...\" intro. I liked this, as a sucker for music videos with good songs, and I felt like it added an additional degree of stylisation to what is a very meta-narrative focused game. For those wanting to jump straight into Alan Wake 2, I'd at least recommend watching a refresher or a quick summary of the first game's story, as all the important actors for the second game are well established or hinted at in the first.

It's a roguelite deckbuilding game that hits great highs, but not without a few caveats. First off the game, especially the first half of the game (more on that later), nails the same feeling Inscryption's first act has: a straight dopamine hit stemming from easily assembling amazing runs that make you feel like you broke the game. Simultaneously chasing those godly runs while dealing with difficult challenges that threaten to cut your time short is what make games like Inscryption, Vampire Survivors and Balatro a blast to play. In Balatro, you have a # of hands and a # of discards with which to reach a threshold of points (called a blind). You play with the classic poker hands, from high card to straight flush, each giving you an increasing number of chips (points) and mult (multiplies your points). Between rounds, you spend earned money on card packs that include: jokers, arcana, planets, spectral cards and enhanced cards and vouchers. Your main deckbuilding mechanic are jokers, which give passive buffs of all types. There are 152 jokers in all, which give effects like bonus chips and mult for certain card types or hand types, extra money when discarding, etc etc etc. As rounds go on, the threshold of points increases quickly, and you'll need to set up a powerful combo of effects to make it past the 8th and final round. Each round has 3 blinds, the 3rd of which is a boss with special maluses. Now that you know what this game's about, I'm going to spend the rest of this review getting into what I don't like about it, and why I think it's a rung under Inscryption and Vampire Survivors. Balatro's two biggest problems are that the game's scaling difficulty mechanics feel too punitive and restrictive, and that runs don't give the player enough time to establish a strategy, both of which result in knowing if your run is a hit or a dud after the first two shops, aka the first minute of a run. Small nitpick: there's a quick restart button, which would be nice except for the fact that your first blind is just you and a 52-card deck with no jokers or specials yet, which gets old real quick. It's not hard to beat by any measure, but a run should really start with a shop then a blind. Another interesting issue that arises from the very fabric of the game is that, at least in my not-a-poker-master opinion, it's by far better to ignore the better poker hands such as full house, straight flush, and instead focus your strategy on high card or pair (or with lots of restarts to get the right joker, flush or straight). The reason is simple: over 8 rounds, you'll play 24 blinds and likely more than 24 hands. Even with 3 or more discards, your chances of hitting a straight every blind is low. After the third round, only hands that are supported by your jokers are going to make you any points. Better to focus your strategy on pairs, which you're likely to always get, or on high card which is always available. As such, it feels strange to say that the most viable strategy is to go against how poker works. I didn't get 100% of achievements in this game, because once you get to Black Stake (mid-tier difficulty), the game begins to feel overly repetitive for the reasons above. You start runs, restart them if you don't get a good first or second joker, and keep doing that until you get a good run. That said, I still had a blast with Balatro, and it was a super satisfying card game for 14 hours of play that I'm sure could entertain you for dozens more.","title":"Balatro"},{"location":"reviews/balatro/#balatro","text":"","title":"Balatro"},{"location":"reviews/balatro/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/balatro/#playtime-14-hours","text":"This addictive, one-more-run card game has you setting up combos using poker hands and a full house of complementary power-ups in ever-increasing challenges.

Small nitpick: there's a quick restart button, which would be nice except for the fact that your first blind is just you and a 52-card deck with no jokers or specials yet, which gets old real quick. It's not hard to beat by any measure, but a run should really start with a shop then a blind. Another interesting issue that arises from the very fabric of the game is that, at least in my not-a-poker-master opinion, it's by far better to ignore the better poker hands such as full house, straight flush, and instead focus your strategy on high card or pair (or with lots of restarts to get the right joker, flush or straight). The reason is simple: over 8 rounds, you'll play 24 blinds and likely more than 24 hands. Even with 3 or more discards, your chances of hitting a straight every blind is low. After the third round, only hands that are supported by your jokers are going to make you any points. Better to focus your strategy on pairs, which you're likely to always get, or on high card which is always available. As such, it feels strange to say that the most viable strategy is to go against how poker works. I didn't get 100% of achievements in this game, because once you get to Black Stake (mid-tier difficulty), the game begins to feel overly repetitive for the reasons above. You start runs, restart them if you don't get a good first or second joker, and keep doing that until you get a good run. That said, I still had a blast with Balatro, and it was a super satisfying card game for 14 hours of play that I'm sure could entertain you for dozens more.","title":"Playtime: 14 hours"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/","text":"Baldur\u2019s Gate 1, 2 & Throne of Bhaal Score: 8/10 Playtime: 90 hours An epic high fantasy adventure that does something no other game has really done since: deliver a lvl 1 to 20+ D&D adventure. Go from zero to god-slaying hero, from 6hp mage with magic missile to picking epic-level feats like Summon Planetar and the legendary Spike Trap. Throughout this review, I\u2019ll refer to both games and the DLC as one game, as they follow seamlessly from one to the other, including a character import feature that Bioware would later use in Mass Effect! Gameplay and Combat. I have to start with the part that grinds my gears the hardest, and is responsible for the 2 points off this game\u2019s total score. Baldur\u2019s Gate uses a complete adaptation of D&D\u2019s 2nd edition ruleset, which includes a lot of mechanics we aren\u2019t used to like THAC0 (lower AC is better) and % based magic resist. The overall gameplay loop is what you\u2019d expect from a crpg: you talk to people in town, go questing in dungeons or crypts or sewers, and collect loot after bad mouthing the boss for walking into your legion of spike traps. But before we talk about what Baldur\u2019s Gate does right, let\u2019s talk about what it does terribly wrong. I\u2019ve identified three main issues with the gameplay: encounter balance, clarity of information and the core gameplay loop\u2026 Honestly something I\u2019ve seen in all crpgs I\u2019ve played is horrendous encounter balance. Some are minor offenders, like BG3 and Divinity 2, and some are horrible like Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous.. The devs\u2019 philosophy seems to be \u201cplayers can reload so we should make fights as hard as possible\u201d, and BG1&2 is definitely guilty of this. The game too often makes use of the classic cutscene-into-combat technique which leaves you without buffs or traps and with bad positioning. Dungeons are filled with inexplicable groups of dozens of mind flayers/beholders/what-have-you, and most immersion-shattering of all are the groups of random humans who can go toe-to-toe with our godlings, such as the infamous sewer adventurers who had no relation to the plot but just happened to be a full party of lvl 16+ characters capable of casting Time Stop and other great spells. This made us constantly wary of any foe we went up against, which leads me to my second point\u2026 Clarity of information. It\u2019s hard, nay impossible to know if Zorl the cleric and Tarnor the fighter are going to be a walk in the park or a nightmare of an encounter until you engage them and you either steamroll them or die in 6 seconds. This got worse with levels, as trying to fight without your buffs up resulted in very fast deaths. On top of that, since the game includes every spell in the cleric and wizard book plus monster abilities, there\u2019s a lot to know. And none of that information is presented upfront; you have to check your own spellbook or look it up online. Fights wouldn\u2019t be so terrible, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it\u2019s often prohibitively difficult to see what\u2019s going on because the combat log scrolls back to the bottom every time something new happens. Often so many things happen at once that the chat is completely overloaded. For example, it became common for enemies to initiate combat with multiple buffs applied through spell chaining (I guess they\u2019re all high level mages), so the start of a fight would have no less than 30 to 60 lines of messages. Try scrolling through that to find the one important line where they cast Protection from Magical Weapons, Stoneskin or Spell Reflection. This resulted in us essentially giving up on finding out what\u2019s happening in a given fight, resulting in\u2026 The core gameplay loop, which consists of: buffing, quicksaving, walking into an encounter, reloading till we won, long resting, buffing, quicksaving, repeat ad nauseam for every fight in a dungeon, which there are a lot of. As we got higher level, there were more buffs to apply, fights required more reloading and everything took longer. The price to pay for 9th-level spells I guess. The difficulty and our lack of will to engage with the mechanics in-depth resulted in lots of savescumming, and relying on cheesy tactics such as pulling enemies from off-screen and spike traps, the ultimate trap that bypasses any resist. Special extra paragraph for everything else I hated: anything that removed all our buffs (beholders and certain bosses just having a \u201cRemove Magic\u201d move), magic resist, protection from magic weapons, regeneration, mislead, trap detection taking longer than 5s, \u201cyou can\u2019t open this lock for reasons\u201d, time stop for wasting our time, enemies reapplying buffs at half and 1/3rd hp through contingency, and every debuff spell lasting 3 real-life minutes. Story. The story\u2019s decent. It\u2019s easy to see most of the twists coming, and there\u2019s definitely a dated feeling to the main story. It felt like a D&D campaign you\u2019d play at home, which is a good thing. I think the real strength of the story came from all the side stories peppered throughout the world. Oh and the game tries to make you care for your adopted sister Imogen, screw you Imogen no one cares about your problems. Vibes. Wow, I\u2019ve written a lot of negative points about the game. I must really hate it. Wrong! As you can see from the score, I quite like the game. There\u2019s an inherent joy in playing the adult version of fantasy make-believe, and Baldur\u2019s Gate captures the tabletop feel better than most. The wide pool of systems and mechanics, environments and characters all come together into a sum greater than its parts. It\u2019s hard to point to one specific thing BG does right and say \u201cthat\u2019s why this is a good game\u201d, so I\u2019ll just list a few. A veritable deluge of characters, many of which had enough personality to stand out, even if we only spoke to them for a few, brief moments. They made the game feel like I imagine the Forgotten Realms. Good dialogue options and good writing. It\u2019s Bioware at its finest, which is to say most of the time, your roleplay can be represented by the options you pick. Vibing music. The intro screen song alone should be enough to convince you this game has a good soundtrack, and I\u2019m really sad it\u2019s not on Spotify so I can\u2019t use it for my own D&D games. A mountain of quests. I mentioned how the game brings you from zero to hero, well that includes a huge variety of quests. Investigate serial killings in the city, save a king from a troll invasion, banish a shadow lord from the forests, unmask a doppelganger conspiracy and so on. Finally, a complete character journey in any way you want it: control a party of 6 or play solo; pick mage, thief, fighter, druid, cleric, etc. with about 30 specializations. Multiclass or dual class (that\u2019s leveling 2 classes simultaneously on one character). Learn every spell in the game, cast Wish or Meteor Shower, contingency all the best defensive spells. As a fighter, hit enemies 12 times a turn with Greater Whirlwind, or click a button to only crit for a round. It\u2019s the kind of game that begs to be replayed and have its mechanics explored in detail. Overall, my personal experience with this game is a 10/10 because of my shared playthrough with William. His character voices and our lambasting of the plot made the experience all the more enjoyable, and I have to credit the game for having a decently well set-up online multiplayer. As a game that stands on its own, however, I give it a final score of 8/10.","title":"Baldur's Gate 2"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#baldurs-gate-1-2-throne-of-bhaal","text":"","title":"Baldur\u2019s Gate 1, 2 &amp; Throne of Bhaal"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#playtime-90-hours","text":"An epic high fantasy adventure that does something no other game has really done since: deliver a lvl 1 to 20+ D&D adventure.

Some of these systems I enjoyed interacting with, others were too much for my laid back idle playstyle.

This latest entry in the series that defined (top down isometric looter) ARPGs is a sour note that ranks last in my personal tierlist of the genre. Gameplay. Let's start with the positives. The combat is weighty, with skill animations that feel better to use than other ARPGs (PoE2 might contest this). While I'm not a fan of how simple the skill system is, I respect that each skill feels useful in its own right. On the open world side of things, it's a little hit or miss. What I like is the quick transport via horseback, and I really like that you can unlock all kinds of skill modifiers by clearing optional dungeons. On to the negatives. First complaint: monsters that leave behind delayed explosions when they die is not fun design. It's like 50% of elite mobs in this game that do that. Otherwise combat's pretty neat-o. For the campaign, sidequests and general NPC interactions, the most annoying thing by far is the delay between talking sections and animations. Like, every time someone talks or something's supposed to happen, you can see the trigger happen. You wait there 1, 2, sometimes 3 seconds while nothing happens before they become interactable, or before monsters spawn. It doesn't seem like much, but it happens every time, everywhere, and it really breaks the gameplay immersion which is otherwise fast-pace. The gimmicky mmo-like quest aspects are annoying af. Escorting people that walk at a snail's pace, carry thing to guy, go to location and talk to go to other location and talk again. I don't mind these things in an mmo, where I'm used to a slower pace, but in an arpg it feels really out of place. The gameplay also really slows down in the last 2 acts, becoming like 60% talking, 30% walking in empty hallways (where are the enemies? Did they forget to put them in?) and 10% fighting. Graphics. My main gripe with the graphics is the washed-out brown filter on top of everything. That, mixed with the art direction going for a gritty dark toned-down realism, makes the game kind of bland to look at most of the time. While there's a lot of controversy around Diablo 3's decision to go with a cartoony art style, I must note that at the very least it was fun to look at. The UI is my second biggest gripe - it's ugly. They have an amazing art team at Blizzard, but there's a strong lack of that in the UI's design. It's blazingly fast, thanks programmers, but way less visually interesting than D2 or 3's gothic style. A lot of the panels are too flat, and some parts, like the health bars, even look dangerously close to Unreal default assets. That said, D4 doesn't do everything wrong graphics-wise. Blizzard still has a hell of an art team, and their work shines through in a few places. Some corners of the map are beautifully designed even if the map at large is bland. The player character's model looks great in cutscenes and the loading screen (but not in the UI). Armor and weapons are nice, even though I'll always lament how cool designs go to the cash shop. Story. ARPGs always struggle with the story, and Diablo 4 is no exception. There's an effort to make an interesting story with Lilith playing the (slightly, barely) morally grey bad guy. You follow her trail all campaign long, allying with a few key characters and ultimately slaying her at the end. I'll say the story was decently engaging, but I wouldn't rate it above a 5/10. There's certainly an over-reliance on talking segments, exposition dumps and overly-dark story beats. Especially that last one. Someone needs to present a talk to the Diablo writers about peaks and valleys, because this whole game is just valleys except for like 2 moments of banding together with your friends and slaying the BBEG. Doesn't matter if it's a main quest, a side quest, a random NPC in town or a journal entry you picked up. Every minor character betrays you, dies, turns into a demon, is eternal tortured then dies or betrays you. It very quickly becomes \"yeah yeah the world's dark I get it how horrible\". Overall , Diablo 4 continues a downwards trend in the Diablo franchise, worsening the gameplay loop in favour of chasing money. The open world-esque mechanics, while showing potential, are lacking Blizzard's usual polish, which is a statement that can apply to the game at large. Without my love of ARPGs and the thrill of playing on hardcore, I doubt I would've enjoyed myself at all. As such, I give Diablo 4 a 7/10 score.","title":"Diablo 4"},{"location":"reviews/diablo4/#diablo-4","text":"","title":"Diablo 4"},{"location":"reviews/diablo4/#score-710","text":"","title":"Score: 7/10"},{"location":"reviews/diablo4/#playtime-26-hours","text":"Diablo 4 is the sad spawn of a studio that's been missing more than hitting in recent years.

But I did find myself confused on where to go at times, maybe because I took a couple breaks while playing, maybe cuz I had difficulty immersing myself deeply into the very dense world of politics and ideologies they created.

Featuring turn-based tactical combat and a complex system of rock-paper-scissors and terrain-based combo effects. The Good The combat system presents a straightforward question of \u201cshould I use physical or magic damage to beat this guy\u201d and sometimes \u201cif magic, what element to use\u201d. However, it keeps this core mechanic always engaging thanks to a deep system of terrain combos and crowd control options to complicate things and turn fights into tactical puzzles. Fights, especially boss fights, are very creative, always throwing different problems at you: swarms of weak enemies, waves of bad guys, wizard that can teleport you into instakill terrain, resistances or even healing from various elements, timed terrain features like meteors raining from the sky. It always felt fresh and interesting to win these encounters. Builds are varied and super fun to experiment with. You can mix styles together and customize your 2 or 4 party members with complementary builds, such as earth magic juggernaut tanks, necromantic archers, elementalist druids, polymorphing rogues and so many more. Plus, respeccing is easy and free, so you can change your playstyle on the fly. During our game, I respecced from a two-handed water magic paladin to a reflective damage cc-heavy juggernaut. The quest system is probably the crowning jewel of the game: you can approach quests in an open-ended way, making the game really feel like a tabletop RPG with a natural flow of how you go from one quest to the next. Example: A thug has an elf in captivity, blaming him of stealing his drugs. You can get this quest by speaking to the thug, who wants his drugs back. You can speak to the elf behind bars, or the elf\u2019s tribe, or the guy who actually stole his drugs, or a dog who saw the whole thing happen. If you found the thief first and got the drugs back, you can just show up to the thug, skip the whole quest explanation and say \u201chere\u2019s your drugs, I have them on me\u201d. You can also ignore the entire drug thing and just talk to the elf, then lockpick his cage and leave with him. Expand this to every quest in the game, and maps begin to feel like naturally interweaving stories. Following up on quests, by paying attention to notes, or what\u2019s on a corpse, or writing on a cave wall, you can uncover secrets people try to keep hidden. This game is chock full of secrets waiting to be discovered by players with an eye for detail, and it was a huge part of our fun to find those secrets and be rewarded for them. Acts 2 & 4 are both the majority of the game and its most enjoyable stories, containing complex webs of quests in different tones and flavors that smoothly progress your character\u2019s story and reveal the world\u2019s lore in interesting and fun ways. The Bad Terrain effects and line-of-sight can be a pain in fights, with ranged attacks blocked by random protrusions (esp. guard rails), and fire on the ground causing your character to path all the way around instead of through it. These aren\u2019t as bad once you get used to the combat system, but they do take some working around. The first Act is very long, and you only have access to a few early-level skills. It\u2019s meant to be an intro to the game\u2019s quest and combat systems, but the length of it detracts from the game\u2019s overall enjoyment as it delays the arrival of the very strong Act 2. Act 3, while much shorter than the others, lacks focus until you reach the ending dungeon. It could\u2019ve used a shorter first half and more of a payoff in the second half to keep it on par with its preceding and following acts. (Personal opinion) We tried doing a full good guys playthrough, and while you do get to save the day very often, you find that a lot of characters are either assholes or downright evil, enough that we remarked on it near the end: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure 6 out of 10 people in this world are sworn to the God-King of evil\u201d. Still, the moments of true triumph over evil were very satisfying. Nitpicks The downside of creative fights is that a couple of them have downright annoying design and we needed to look up how to beat them as there was no indication in-game of what to do. The story\u2019s pacing could have used some refinement. A lot of the twists and big reveals happen at the absolute end of the game, at the last fight, which doesn\u2019t give it time to breathe and ends up less impactful/rushed. Overall I feel like this game was a resounding success. The core gameplay of investigating leads, dungeon crawling and boss fighting is entertaining, even after multiple playthroughs thanks to the variable approaches to quests. Different builds are rewarding enough to want to play again and again, and drop-in multiplayer + free full respec make that replay value even more enticing. The game oozes high fantasy charm with a light-hearted approach, and its maps are filled with details, crafted with evident love and attention. It\u2019s a great RPG to play alone or with friends, and one of my favorites of the past 10 years.","title":"Divinity: Original Sin 2"},{"location":"reviews/divinityoriginalsin2/#divinity-original-sin-2","text":"","title":"Divinity: Original Sin 2"},{"location":"reviews/divinityoriginalsin2/#score-9510","text":"","title":"Score: 9.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/divinityoriginalsin2/#playtime-177-hours","text":"An epic high fantasy RPG from a top-down, isometric perspective.

The villains are evil and bent on world domination, and the good guys are trying to stop them. It\u2019s refreshingly straightforward. In direct contrast, Book 3 covers themes like the horrors of war, the line between revolution and terrorism, and the evils of magic. I didn\u2019t like it as much at first, but it improved later in the story when we find out that one side is being manipulated by, you guessed it, a great evil bent on world domination. Leveling. Leveling feels good. It\u2019s fast enough, and class skills aren\u2019t tied to level, instead they\u2019re leveled separately by doing class quests and wearing the class\u2019 armor. I like this system, because it gives great flexibility in trying out multiple classes and switching whenever you feel like it. The only minus is that the ability to \u201csave\u201d your armor, aka be wearing it when you log in, is locked behind a real money item. Luckily I had just enough coins leftover from my purchase of the Dragon Amulet pack to afford it. Loot. This game has weird loot rules. Every quest will give you a piece of gear, but the gear\u2019s level is random and isn\u2019t constrained by your character level. You can get a lvl 74 sword at level 5, or a level 26 belt at level 50. At first I kept higher-level items, but then I realized I got so many it was useless and the only items worth keeping were those near my level. Combat. The combat\u2019s actually decent!

Another thing is the dungeon exploration; sometimes it\u2019s real hard to know which way leads to another room and which is just decoration.","title":"Playtime: ~30-40 hours"},{"location":"reviews/dredge/","text":"Dredge Score: 9/10 Playtime: 9 hours Dredge is a fishing game with a cthulhu twist. Gameplay. In Dredge, you travel the sea, catching fish and dredging up things from the deep (mostly lumber and metal) for quests and personal profit. The game starts off slow, but it quickly picks up the pace as you gain a teleport spell and equip faster engines, allowing you to zoom across the map and making the at-first foreboding ocean seem perfectly traversable. The day-night cycle is quite short, requiring you to either brave the night's terrors or retreat to a dock to sleep. I often found myself braving the night, as with bright enough lights and not too much traveling, you can safely fish your way through to the morning hours. I would only go back to rest when the panic meter got to high, or when I was trying to get somewhere risky and didn't want the nighttime dangers on top of that. The fishing gameplay consists of different timing mechanics, none of which are innovative but all of which achieve their goal: if you fail, time passes and you approach night quicker. Succeed, and you can catch more fish in a shorter amount of time. What's really important to note that the game doesn't tell you, is that there's no clock counting down. You're free to fish your days away near town if you want, accumulating as much money and upgrades as you feel comfortable with before doing anything. At the beginning, I really felt like my gamer conditioning was kicking in, as I always tried to squeeze as much as possible out of my poor boat before heading back to rest. I had to unlearn that pattern for this game, and I had a much easier time once I started resting whenever I needed it to keep my panic at zero. The overarching goal of the game is to visit each island/biome and recover an artifact, each of which requires you to do a quest in that region. It served as a simple and straightforward way to get you to explore everything, and gave a good sense of completion once you finished each quest (or pursuits as they're called here). Story. The story is shrouded in mystery for most of the game, laid out in notes you can pick up as you fish around the map. It really kicks into gear at the ending, with a solid twist and a conclusion that strikes the perfect balance of inescapable fate and \"good end, you did it\" feel. The writing throughout the game, whether is be the descriptions of fish, UI messages, or conversations with NPCs, evokes a disquiet and existential dread that perfectly suits the game. Art. The environment art is serviceable, but the creature and character art really shines. It does a good job of conveying the feel of a mythos game. Sound. The sounds are what bring this game from an 8 to a 9/10. They highlight why good audio is so important in horror: without the bubbling water, deep gurgles, sudden whispers and the oppressive blanket of silence from the fog, Dredge would feel almost cutesy. With them, the game is able to unsettle you just enough to create a good horror atmosphere. Special shoutout to the strings that play when you catch an aberrant fish - something unexpected and strange happened. Overall, Dredge's sound design and writing nail the cthulhu mythos vibe, and its gameplay treads a fine line between hurried adventure and relax fishing sim. At a reasonable playtime of 9 hours, it doesn't overstay its welcome and, other than a slow start, keeps the enjoyment meter high throughout.","title":"Dredge"},{"location":"reviews/dredge/#dredge","text":"","title":"Dredge"},{"location":"reviews/dredge/#score-910","text":"","title":"Score: 9/10"},{"location":"reviews/dredge/#playtime-9-hours","text":"Dredge is a fishing game with a cthulhu twist.

Gameplay. There's an amazing variety of builds thanks to all the weapons, weapon arts, spells and statuses. Definitely enough content to keep you playing multiple runs, and have each one feel fun and powerful. We've come a long way from DS1 faith builds using 1 spell. It really feels like they improved on an already amazing combat system which most people thought had been perfected in Dark Souls 3. That said, in reaching new heights the devs have created a few imbalances. For example, I don't like how poise breaking works; staggers feel too powerful and repeatable. Bosses that punish dodge rolls much more severely than previous games pushed me to first try out shields, then go full damage + stagger. On subsequent playthroughs, when I tried non-staggering weapons I felt very nerfed compared to reliable stagger builds. I like summons, I played with them on NG+ and found that while they trivialize some bosses and make the game overall easier, they're a great mechanic to help lower difficulty for players while being integrated in the world (vs. a menu toggle), which is very in line with Souls game design. Plus they enable ranged builds very well, which is great for build diversity. I disliked how big the world is, too much travel time on horseback before getting somewhere interesting. It's a minor gripe compared to the amazing feeling of discovering new zones, but the downtime of just riding places for 5 minutes is jarring compared to every other souls game which were nonstop action in smaller, streamlined zones. It's more noticeable on a second playthrough when you know where you want to go and the only thing stopping you is distance. I found that once I reached Leyndell, the capital, I enjoyed the game a lot more. That's because Leyndell, the catacombs, and many areas afterwards don't let you get on your horse and thus were designed in a more traditional Souls game style. Story. Out of all the Souls games, not including Sekiro or Bloodborne, this one had the story I liked the most. The NPCs have more personality than just sad crazy guy, sad angry guy and sad sad guy. The endings are varied in tone and allow you to make your mark on the world in limited, but exciting ways. The setting is simultaneously more complex and easier to understand than any souls game before it. My only slight gripe is that Melina, despite being front and center at the beginning of the game, has less personality and development than any of the sidequest NPCs. Twould have been nice to see a little more emotion out of that wooden block. Overall, the open world concept has a lot to love but felt worse to me than the streamlined maps of previous Souls game. Despite that, I can't deny that Elden Ring shines in its exploration, while reaching for the stars in every aspect of Souls-like gameplay. The devs took their tried and true formula and made something new and great with it, that still has teeny tiny spaces for improvement. For that reason, and because it falls outside my top 3 FromSoft games, Elden Ring deserves a stellar 9.5/10.","title":"Elden Ring"},{"location":"reviews/eldenring/#elden-ring","text":"","title":"Elden Ring"},{"location":"reviews/eldenring/#score-9510","text":"","title":"Score: 9.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/eldenring/#playtime-78-hours-ng-complete-100-achievs","text":"Elden Ring is a game where you run around in a loincloth slaying gods with a +5 club and masochistically refuse to use entire mechanics on the premise that it makes the game too easy.

Gameplay. The most important aspect of an arpg, the gameplay is divided into two main aspects: Planning and experimenting with builds, and killing monsters with the build. In the planning and experimenting department, Grim Dawn does very well, boasting a wide swath of gameplay styles and potential builds thanks to its dual class system (essentially, you pick two classes to play and can level them both up together). On top of that, refunding skill points is pretty cheap, making experimentation easy. Refunding attribute points is a lil tougher which is annoying and feels like an unnecessary blocker, but luckily you rarely have to change your attributes. When it comes to killing monsters, I find that it falls a bit behind its peers due to a lack of oomph in most skill animations, and a colour palette that\u2019s a little too monochromatic makes enemies and environments blend together. The mechanical balance of the game is, however, quite good, and a well-built character will make enemies go splat at a satisfying speed. Grind. Once you get to lategame, my usual complaints for arpgs crop up. The grind is much too long, and once again cool items and sets are locked behind arbitrary drop rates. I get that some people like spending hundreds of hours and making dozens of characters just to get one character kitted out in top tier gear, but I\u2019d really enjoy it if these games introduced a \u201cdad with no free time\u201d mode for singleplayer that tweaks drop rates. As it stands, even with a mod increasing drop rates by 12x, I had trouble finding decent items. Something that particularly irked me is that all the cool uniques and all sets are global random drops, meaning there\u2019s no specific boss or spot you can farm for an item; you just have to play more of the game. I prefer the goal-oriented style of Diablo 2 where I farmed a boss looking for an item drop. My one complaint about the build system is that gear affixes, aka the components and augments you stick on your gear, had way too much importance. In the endgame, they were as important as the full set of purple gear you\u2019d be wearing. Trying to go without them or with too weak versions would spell certain death. Because they\u2019re affixes and not gear pieces themselves, and because they need to be crafted from recipes and aren\u2019t found as drops, I found them lame and annoying and they didn\u2019t give a feeling of excitement or coolness when you finally crafted that top level component. The difficulty curve is actually quite good, with the usual 3 tiers of normal, veteran and ultimate. Other than the gear affix system getting in the way of a smooth leveling curve, my only (minor) complaint is that you\u2019ll find the usual arpg problem on ultimate difficulty of getting instagibbed and not knowing wtf happened until you look up the creature on the game\u2019s wiki and realize you\u2019re missing 10% poison resistance or something. Art. I mentioned it briefly, but the art in Grim Dawn doesn\u2019t stand up to the likes of Diablo, even Diablo 2. The enemy and zone designs just aren\u2019t as interesting, and the animations are serviceable. Overall the art wasn\u2019t so terrible it was a detriment, but it didn\u2019t augment the experience. Story. There\u2019s an effort to have a story, which I\u2019d even call a step above other arpgs, but it still falls short of being interesting. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Grim Dawn. It scratched the itch for an arpg and its core gameplay was solid enough for me to play through all 3 difficulties and make a few different characters to try out fun builds. It doesn\u2019t do anything to innovate and it falls into most of the usual pitfalls, but it\u2019s still a solid entry into the genre. I\u2019d like to give a special shout out to the achievements for being well spaced out, motivating me to play a little more each time to get that next rare achievement.","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#grim-dawn","text":"","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#score-7510","text":"","title":"Score: 7.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#playtime-54-hours","text":"An isometric action RPG that fancies itself as a contender for the throne against rivals Diablo and Path of Exile, Grim Dawn does a lot right by the player while leaving some aspects less polished.

It's fast-paced, requiring quick fingers and reaction time and a good deal of tactical thinking. You zoom through maps, stopping to kill bosses, complete quests and pick up loot.

It feels kinda like a slower burn version of Vampire Survivor. I liked it a lot. Skill tree and builds: Deserves its own section cuz it's so massive. The game lets you build pretty much any type of character to fulfill any kind of class fantasy or gameplay style, though there is a clear favoritism for ranged over melee. The skill tree is intimidating at first, but conquerable with the help of guides. It's quite simple in the end, you pick a playstyle and work your way towards the nodes that fit your style, with branching off to pick up much-needed survivability in the form of hp, energy shield/armor/evasion, and elemental resists. Once you get a build going, the nodes basically pick themselves. Story: In an ARPG? Bwahaha. But for real, the game has lore and a good deal of writing and voice acting. I do feel it fades into the background too much, it's too easy to skip the dialogue and keep killing stuff. I'd like if they add little face portraits when talking to important NPCs, like in Hades kinda. It would help a lot in creating a link with the NPC, cuz as it stands from the top-down perspective they all look samey. Flaws: The game has its fair share of them. I have 3 that annoy me the most: First, it's possible but quite difficult to get respec points, to the point that a lot of players just make a new character and play through the whole story again to try out a new build. In a game all about trying out fun builds, I don't like this. Even just changing my witch from one curse playstyle to another was impossible because it would have cost more respec points than I got in the whole campaign. Second, you sometimes need a PhD to know what killed you. Bosses can have a ton of randomized keywords, a lot of which you have to look up on the wiki to understand. I played a supertank cuz I didn't want to have to deal with this, and I succeeded except for a few rare instances where I'd go from taking 0 damage to just dying outright. Third, the game's aesthetic is not great. I spent most of it pantless, wearing mismatching gear that looked like I got it from a thrift shop. The graphics and art style are passable, but nothing to write home about, and often unclear as to what you're killing or who you're talking to. Play this game for the gameplay, not anything else.

That's what cool kids call shoot 'em up games, or so I hear. It's a roguelite, top-down, procedurally generated bullet hell. Gameplay. You play through 5 levels of increasing difficulty, each level being made up of rooms which are self-contained fights with randomized enemies and layouts. There's swarms of mobs, mini bosses, special events, upgrades, shops, hidden doors and more. The variety of gameplay elements and enemy mixups keeps the runs fresh. Another thing keeping runs fresh are the guns. A solid ten or so base types, including laser, gatling, revolver, pulsar and sword, all of which are enhanced by a huge list of modifiers: phasing bullets that go through walls, exploding, slow, shotgun, split, execute, etc. etc. you get the picture. The only drawback for me was that the overwhelming amount of possible configurations, stacked on top of the passive upgrades and other bonuses you accumulated during a run, made it difficult to know what gun was the right choice when it came time to pick one up. Sometimes I got godly guns that could clear rooms and kill bosses like nobody's business, other times guns I thought would be amazing were a real uphill struggle to use. The most important part of a schmup game are not the guns, but the bosses. Star of Providence provides in spades here too, with multiple potential bosses per floor, as well as layers of secret bosses to be unlocked past floor 5. The bosses feel fair, climbing in difficulty throughout the floors, feeling challenging but never impossible. I only beat the 5 floors, I didn't get to the secret bosses, so I can't speak from experience for the entirety of the game. But I know that given enough time and practice, even I could beat the last bosses. The game even features additional side content, like the arcade levels and hacking minigames, for more gameplay types and replayability. I didn't do too much of these, but what I did do seemed fleshed out and quite fun. Shout-out to the music, which felt like good solid indie 8-bit tracks. Lots of variety here too, I think there's around 86 tracks or something, and they meshed well with the gameplay. Overall, I enjoyed my short time playing Star of Providence. I'm not a pro schmup player by any means, I'd even say it's far outside my wheelhouse, but I can appreciate a well-crafted game when I play one. I don't regret buying it on sale, and I'm happy I played it even though I didn't get the true ending for once.","title":"Star of Providence"},{"location":"reviews/starofprovidence/#star-of-providence","text":"","title":"Star of Providence"},{"location":"reviews/starofprovidence/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/starofprovidence/#playtime-6-hours","text":"Star of Providence is a schmup game.

The Good Did you like Subnautica? Did you enjoy exploring the unknown, going ever deeper underwater, seeing beautiful biomes and scary creatures? Well this has all of that, feeling fresh and new. Special shoutout to base building which got a substantial upgrade, now with large rooms and tons of new knick knacks to place everywhere. Plus, I actually enjoyed the new characters and voice acting. The writing is a bit on the weak side for some of it, but other part (your alien friend) are quite fun. The Bad Honestly, there aren\u2019t that many bad things about the game, mostly lots of nitpicks. A cumulation of the nitpicks leads to one glaring flaw: the flow of the game isn\u2019t as good as the first game\u2019s. What I mean by \u201cflow\u201d is how naturally the game moves you from one zone to the next, by subtly guiding you through story and blueprints and resources, without explicitly telling you \u201cgo here, do this\u201d. Nitpicks Location markers. The game gives you too many right at the beginning, and instead of leading to crashed pods that are incidentally next to new zones to explore, they lead you straight to the important areas. This lessens the feel of exploration and makes it more \u201cswim straight to marker, do stuff, swim to next marker\u201d. Inversely, there are a couple of times locations should\u2019ve really had markers, but didn\u2019t. There\u2019s a meetup point you\u2019re supposed to go to with the instructions \u201c1 km east of here\u201d, which leads you to a sea of icebergs that all look the same. It took me a youtube video and 20 minutes to find the right one. The default aggressive-but-not-really-dangerous sea critter (equivalent to the Stalker in the first game) has a roar that is way too loud. It sounds like a leviathan roaring, and you\u2019re going to hear it all the time since they\u2019re everywhere. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s louder than the actual shrimpy leviathan that inhabits the shallower waters. It takes away from scarier stuff noises since it\u2019s so loud, at first scary-sounding but quickly enough becomes annoying and ignorable. There\u2019s an above-ground section of the game you have to do for the story. It isn\u2019t terrible per say, but it\u2019s just a bit inferior to everything underwater. I appreciate that they tried something different though. The seatruck, while having cool modules, doesn\u2019t have the great feeling of upgrading from the seamoth to the cyclops. Overall, I think Subnautica: Below Zero is a lesser game than its predecessor, but an important part of the dev team\u2019s growth, as they experimented with many new ideas. I just hope they take the right lessons moving forward. The game is still solid fun and worthy of a playthrough, but if I were introducing new players to the series, I\u2019d go with the first.","title":"Subnautica: Below Zero"},{"location":"reviews/subnauticabelowzero/#subnautica-below-zero","text":"","title":"Subnautica: Below Zero"},{"location":"reviews/subnauticabelowzero/#score-7510","text":"","title":"Score: 7.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/subnauticabelowzero/#playtime-22-hours","text":"If you\u2019ve played the first one you know what this one\u2019s about: underwater exploration, a survival game with an actual story and ending, base building and ship zooming.","title":"Playtime: 22 hours"},{"location":"reviews/subnauticabelowzero/#the-good","text":"Did you like Subnautica?

Gameplay. Dig, explore, slay monsters and bosses, tinker and unlock cool stuff, interact with NPC vendors and uncover all kinds of secrets, all with your friends. It\u2019s the type of game I enjoy playing, as each new thing keeps me excited to find more and discover what\u2019s under the next rock. Talking mechanics, the combat is not great (still better than Valheim\u2019s). The fun part of combat is trying out crazy and kooky new weapons, of which there are a ton. The not so fun part is that boss fights seem to go in the dark souls, even bullet hell direction of tons of lasers and bullets you have to dodge, except the controls aren\u2019t conducive to dodging in that way. Instead, boss fights would entail smacking the boss, chugging potions, and moving in a random pattern hoping you\u2019d get hit less that way; essentially devolving into more of a gear check than any kind of skill expression. Digging and exploration, however, felt great. Zones had an appropriate amount of danger to keep you on your toes, and unique mobs, blocks and treasure were available in every biome. Finding the lava biome at the bottom of the world, or the houses in the clouds, had a real sense of wonder, which I think is the best marker of success for an exploration sandbox game. It felt like the devs were constantly daring you to try new things, promising that there\u2019d be a secret behind every corner. UI. When the official wiki is practically required to play the game, your UI\u2019s lacking. On top of that, the core mechanic that is crafting is poorly implemented, with a weird vertical or horizontal single line scrolling menu with only tiny icons and names. It\u2019s clear the devs don\u2019t have a UI designer or programmer, and I think the game could be greatly improved by hiring one. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind too much since I\u2019m fine using a second monitor to look things up. The wiki\u2019s even linked from the game\u2019s main menu, but all that info should really just be in the game. Information could even be gamified, like in-game hints on how to summon the Wall of Flesh instead of a vague description text on a voodoo doll that definitely doesn\u2019t say you should throw it in lava. Progression. One of the most fun parts of Terraria is how the game quickly builds up from \u201cguy with a pickaxe and some dirt blocks\u201d to having 5 different types of armor, a bunch of crafting stations, magic spells, and being able to fly. The progression flows well, as each boss drops the item required to craft a new station or a new type of ingot, or a key to a new zone. Unlocking hardmode was a thrill, as a huge explosion of new stuff was suddenly at your fingertips all at once, with tougher monsters everywhere. All of a sudden you could visit the sky, a secret temple in the depths of the jungle and a whole new corruption biome. Art. The art is serviceable, sometimes even cute in a pixelated way. Minor complaint is that there can be too many things on screen, making it hard to see a boss in the middle of a sea of lasers, or a crafting station in the middle of the mess that was our base. Overall, Terraria succeeds in being a fun exploration romp with friends, while having a couple of areas, namely combat and the UI/progression, where it could use improvement.

Overall, Terraria succeeds in being a fun exploration romp with friends, while having a couple of areas, namely combat and the UI/progression, where it could use improvement. For that reason, I award it a solid 8/10 fun game score.","title":"Playtime: 102 hours"},{"location":"reviews/vampiresurvivors/","text":"Vampire Survivors Score: 10/10 Playtime: 86 hours, 100% achievements A flawless performance of finding out how high you can go; the game pulls new tricks out of its coffin every time you think you\u2019ve peaked.

You die at minute 11, damn. Too many mobs to deal with. But lo! If you have the right support item and your weapon\u2019s maxed out, it transforms into a better weapon. That\u2019s so cool, you think as you mow down legions of mobs and get past minute 11. What other combinations unlock new weapons? So begins an adventure whence your character will reach untold power with the strength of many evolved weapons. Of course runs always end at minute 30 when Red Death spawns and instakills you.

Great writing, tons of replay value and a rock-solid story overshadow its age and sometimes annoying combat. Story. The story\u2019s just, uh, well, it\u2019s just really good. The writing\u2019s so on point that it surpasses most RPGs except the very best of the best. The characters are fleshed out and likable, the story has a bunch of moving parts, and the dialogue choices actually lead to consequences. This game came out in 2004, and the way they built their dialogue trees could only be matched back then by KotOR from Bioware. Heck, Mass Effect came out 3 years after this! Bloodlines has dialogue options based on your skills, what kind of vamp you are and your story choices. Heck, there\u2019s a certain bloodline, Malkavian, that changes all the dialogue in the game because Malkavians are insane and speak in riddles, prophecies and meta-references. And all the characters you talk to react to that, which is amazing. Combat. It\u2019s terrible! And you love it for it. The game actually gives you the powers to do all sorts of cool vampire stuff, like slow down time, move super fast, throw people around, mesmerize enemies to fight each other and blast your foes with magic. That\u2019s on top of shooting guns or swinging a sword, baseball bat or sledgehammer around! It even mostly succeeds in making you feel like a powerful vampire, moreso than most more modern fang-based games do. The reason it\u2019s terrible is because, well, it\u2019s really old and the combat is just janky. Controls are outdated, sometimes you might get melted in two seconds and some bosses are bullet sponges. At least, overall, the combat doesn\u2019t stop you from progressing the story. My preferred approach was to avoid all that by stealthing everywhere, which worked for 90% of the game except the damned sewer level. Graphics. For such an old game, the graphics are surprisingly impressive. They\u2019re better than Mass Effect 1 or KotOR, that\u2019s for sure. I noted the lighting in particular, which conveyed the vibe or grimy back alleys and haunted mansions very well. Overall, the reason this game is considered a cult classic and the reason it\u2019s in my favorites list and is one of the very rare games I\u2019ve replayed, is because it absolutely nails the atmosphere and feel of the Vampire the Masquerade setting. Everything I\u2019ve mentioned, from the characters and writing to the lighting and even the combat, lend themselves to creating a world that perfectly represents the dark streets of downtown LA, where junkies and creatures of the night coexist. The first game I can think of that does the same is Cyberpunk 2077. So if you can forgive its old age and live through its combat, this game is the epitome of vampire immersion.","title":"Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines"},{"location":"reviews/vampirethemasquerade/#vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines","text":"","title":"Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines"},{"location":"reviews/vampirethemasquerade/#score-9510","text":"","title":"Score: 9.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/vampirethemasquerade/#playtime-45-hours-2-playthroughs","text":"A cult classic vampire RPG positively dripping with atmosphere and style.

Gameplay. As long as you know the rts genre, you know what\u2019s going on here. In the main campaign, you control the Blood Ravens as they mow down hordes of orks, chaos abominations and one eldar. The key difference from other rts is the capture points; maps are covered with capture the flag style points that generate your primary resource. Most missions involve balancing research and production with expansion and consolidation of your control points as you fend off enemy forays. At least, until you amass a deathball or a couple of Terminators or Land Raiders and roll over everything. Art. The art is serviceable, certainly moreso than Starcraft 1. It\u2019s in that sweet spot of old games where everything\u2019s pixelated, but you can still clearly see what models look like. At a glance, the Blood Raven units all look similar. They have red troopers and red vehicles. But after commanding them for a while, you learn to love the quirks of each unit type. This is greatly helped by the audio lines, which nail the oldschool rts feel of repeatability, meme-ability and love-ability. Quotes in the Terminator\u2019s badass deep voices like \u201cA moment of laxity spawns a lifetime of heresy\u201d, or the Land Raider\u2019s radio voice saying \u201cDeath has arrived\u201d. Combat is full of shouts and screams, my favorite being chaos cultists shouting \u201cMY SPLEEN\u201d when they blow up. Story. Believe it or not, the story\u2019s actually decent. You control Captain Gabriel Angelos and his Blood Ravens 3rd company as they repel an ork invasion and investigate signs of chaos incursion on the planet Tartarus. The story hits all the warhammer 40k beats: suspicion, corruption and betrayal battle against faith in the Emperor in our beloved captain. The cutscenes wouldn\u2019t be anything special if it weren\u2019t for the stellar voice acting. The cast gives it 110%, especially the villains, delivering the most bombastic and over-the-top performances they had no right to in an rts, which complements warhammer\u2019s feel perfectly. Overall, Dawn of War stands out as an excellent example of the golden age of rts, and acts as a most enjoyable portal into the world of 40k. I like the Blood Ravens now, and I hope the DLCs will make me like the other factions just as much.","title":"WH40K: Dawn of War"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#wh40k-dawn-of-war","text":"","title":"WH40K: Dawn of War"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#playtime-12-hours","text":"An oldschool rts crafted with love and attention to the lore, Dawn of War has everything I look for when I think \u201cgame like Starcraft 1 but a tiny bit more recent\u201d.

Lovecraft. The gameplay, at first, is simple and serviceable. Everything is menu-driven, and you drive the mysteries forward by visiting locations. Each time you do, a random event is rolled on an appropriate table and something, usually something terrible, happens to you. Combat is resolved in a turn-based manner with an energy bar capping your actions per turn. As a roguelike, you rely on trial and error to learn what works and what doesn't; which mysteries to tackle first and which to leave for later. As a horror roguelike, you can expect to die frequently: any enemy can kill you, and a run tracks your (rapid) progression into madness and/or death. The goal of a run is to complete a few mysteries, unlock the lighthouse, and make it to the top so you can stop this week's Elder God from Beyond (tm) from ruining reality. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of mechanics and the sheer number of options available, in all forms: runs start differently based on which elder god is threatening your town, and which character you choose to start as. There's a veritable armory of terrible weapons, including baseball bats, shaving razors, broken bottles, and even guns. A fun complement to the weapons are the mythos-inspired spells you can hoard in your spellbook, giving you an edge at the cost of your precious sanity. Achievements, usually tied to progressing in the game, unlocked all kinds of new things: characters, weapons, spells, random events, mysteries, dialogue options, companions. None of these made the game easier, mind you, they simply provided more options in each run. The crowning achievement of the game is its art. It really is a great pixel adaptation of Junji Ito's style, and I was always morbidly curious to see what fresh horror the game could pop up on screen. Everything from the main menu to the settings presents a handmade, unified vision of pixel-based spookiness that just works. On the topic of horror, the game isn't actively scary like an Amnesia game, but it does succeed in passively upsetting you with a presentation that radiates anxiety and keeps you on edge. In short, it passes the vibe check. All my complaints about the game (difficulty, not knowing what to do) can be boiled down to me not liking roguelikes. The fact I played this game for more than 20 minutes is a testament to its strong identity that drew me in. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone else unless you're a fan of horror, especially Junji Ito style horror, and you gird your loins in preparation for crushing failure.

Follow hobo-to-hero Ichiban Kasuga as the low-ranking yakuza grunt makes friends and unravels a conspiracy to take over Japan. Gameplay. Traditional entries in the series boast action-adventure gameplay with brawler combat. Like a Dragon replaces that with JRPG questing and combat, complete with turn-based combat, damage types and weaknesses, and gear upgrades. Since the game takes place in modern-day Tokyo and not a medieval fantasy land you may ask, how does the gameplay translate? The answer is hilariously and to great effect. The game's many classes include Hero, Chef, Hobo, Idol and even more out-there options like Night Queen (aka dommy mommy) and Fortuneteller. Abilities range from taking a healing power nap to summoning glowstick-wielding fans to smack down your enemies. Amidst all this apparent insanity, Like a Dragon never forgets its JRPG roots: managing mana, exploiting weaknesses and good ol' grinding for levels will get you through the tougher fights in the game. I was happy to see the unabashed joy with which the devs created all these mechanics, there's a clear love of fun and a willingness to embrace silliness if it makes the game more enjoyable to play. Speaking of fun, the oft-mentioned minigames and side stories were one of the games' defining experiences for me. Each minigame was so out there an idea that was well enough implemented to be buckets of fun to play, and the sidequests were like a microcosm of the main story, easily balancing heartfelt drama with absurdist comedy. My only negative remark about the gameplay is that, like its JRPG inspirations, it can get grindy and repetitive. Like a Dragon is a long game, and for those gamers that want to stay in that world for a good while, it offers a lot of content. But sometimes that content stretches on a bit too long. Story. I was very surprised at how emotional and serious the story could get. Through good writing (my greatest love), the game is able to balance and contrast its tongue-in-cheek gameplay with a story that's equal parts comedy, melodrama, and heroic tale, skillfully managing the rollercoaster of highs and lows that make up a good story. Here too, Like a Dragon is well aware of its JRPG inspiration and delivers a traditional storyline of heroic fantasy, rife with twists, betrayals and shonen protagonist chutzpah. The real trick is that it does all this in a modern-day setting, and remains self-aware enough to occasionally poke fun at itself in the process. Overall, the devs over at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio outdid themselves, elevating both story and gameplay through the weird combination of classic fantasy and modern crime drama.
