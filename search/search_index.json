It's a roguelite deckbuilding game that hits great highs, but not without a few caveats. First off the game, especially the first half of the game (more on that later), nails the same feeling Inscryption's first act has: a straight dopamine hit stemming from easily assembling amazing runs that make you feel like you broke the game. Simultaneously chasing those godly runs while dealing with difficult challenges that threaten to cut your time short is what make games like Inscryption, Vampire Survivors and Balatro a blast to play. In Balatro, you have a # of hands and a # of discards with which to reach a threshold of points (called a blind). You play with the classic poker hands, from high card to straight flush, each giving you an increasing number of chips (points) and mult (multiplies your points). Between rounds, you spend earned money on card packs that include: jokers, arcana, planets, spectral cards and enhanced cards and vouchers. Your main deckbuilding mechanic are jokers, which give passive buffs of all types. There are 152 jokers in all, which give effects like bonus chips and mult for certain card types or hand types, extra money when discarding, etc etc etc. As rounds go on, the threshold of points increases quickly, and you'll need to set up a powerful combo of effects to make it past the 8th and final round. Each round has 3 blinds, the 3rd of which is a boss with special maluses. Now that you know what this game's about, I'm going to spend the rest of this review getting into what I don't like about it, and why I think it's a rung under Inscryption and Vampire Survivors. Balatro's two biggest problems are that the game's scaling difficulty mechanics feel too punitive and restrictive, and that runs don't give the player enough time to establish a strategy, both of which result in knowing if your run is a hit or a dud after the first two shops, aka the first minute of a run. Small nitpick: there's a quick restart button, which would be nice except for the fact that your first blind is just you and a 52-card deck with no jokers or specials yet, which gets old real quick. It's not hard to beat by any measure, but a run should really start with a shop then a blind. Another interesting issue that arises from the very fabric of the game is that, at least in my not-a-poker-master opinion, it's by far better to ignore the better poker hands such as full house, straight flush and even straight or flush, and instead focus your strategy on high card or pair. The reason is simple: over 8 rounds, you'll play 24 blinds and likely more than 24 hands. Even with 3 or more discards, your chances of hitting a straight every blind is low. After the third round, only hands that are supported by your jokers are going to make you any points. Better to focus your strategy on pairs, which you're likely to always get, or on high card which is always available. As such, it feels strange to say that the most viable strategy is to go against how poker works. I didn't get 100% of achievements in this game, because once you get to Black Stake (mid-tier difficulty), the game begins to feel overly repetitive for the reasons above. You start runs, restart them if you don't get a good first or second joker, and keep doing that until you get a good run. That said, I still had a blast with Balatro, and it was a super satisfying card game for 14 hours of play that I'm sure could entertain you for dozens more.","title":"Balatro"},{"location":"reviews/balatro/#balatro","text":"","title":"Balatro"},{"location":"reviews/balatro/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/balatro/#playtime-14-hours","text":"This addictive, one-more-run card game has you setting up combos using poker hands and a full house of complementary power-ups in ever-increasing challenges.

Go from zero to god-slaying hero, from 6hp mage with magic missile to picking epic-level feats like Summon Planetar and the legendary Spike Trap. Throughout this review, I\u2019ll refer to both games and the DLC as one game, as they follow seamlessly from one to the other, including a character import feature that Bioware would later use in Mass Effect! Gameplay and Combat. I have to start with the part that grinds my gears the hardest, and is responsible for the 2 points off this game\u2019s total score. Baldur\u2019s Gate uses a complete adaptation of D&D\u2019s 2nd edition ruleset, which includes a lot of mechanics we aren\u2019t used to like THAC0 (lower AC is better) and % based magic resist. The overall gameplay loop is what you\u2019d expect from a crpg: you talk to people in town, go questing in dungeons or crypts or sewers, and collect loot after bad mouthing the boss for walking into your legion of spike traps. But before we talk about what Baldur\u2019s Gate does right, let\u2019s talk about what it does terribly wrong. I\u2019ve identified three main issues with the gameplay: encounter balance, clarity of information and the core gameplay loop\u2026 Honestly something I\u2019ve seen in all crpgs I\u2019ve played is horrendous encounter balance. Some are minor offenders, like BG3 and Divinity 2, and some are horrible like Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous.. The devs\u2019 philosophy seems to be \u201cplayers can reload so we should make fights as hard as possible\u201d, and BG1&2 is definitely guilty of this. The game too often makes use of the classic cutscene-into-combat technique which leaves you without buffs or traps and with bad positioning. Dungeons are filled with inexplicable groups of dozens of mind flayers/beholders/what-have-you, and most immersion-shattering of all are the groups of random humans who can go toe-to-toe with our godlings, such as the infamous sewer adventurers who had no relation to the plot but just happened to be a full party of lvl 16+ characters capable of casting Time Stop and other great spells. This made us constantly wary of any foe we went up against, which leads me to my second point\u2026 Clarity of information. It\u2019s hard, nay impossible to know if Zorl the cleric and Tarnor the fighter are going to be a walk in the park or a nightmare of an encounter until you engage them and you either steamroll them or die in 6 seconds. This got worse with levels, as trying to fight without your buffs up resulted in very fast deaths. On top of that, since the game includes every spell in the cleric and wizard book plus monster abilities, there\u2019s a lot to know. And none of that information is presented upfront; you have to check your own spellbook or look it up online. Fights wouldn\u2019t be so terrible, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it\u2019s often prohibitively difficult to see what\u2019s going on because the combat log scrolls back to the bottom every time something new happens. Often so many things happen at once that the chat is completely overloaded. For example, it became common for enemies to initiate combat with multiple buffs applied through spell chaining (I guess they\u2019re all high level mages), so the start of a fight would have no less than 30 to 60 lines of messages. Try scrolling through that to find the one important line where they cast Protection from Magical Weapons, Stoneskin or Spell Reflection. This resulted in us essentially giving up on finding out what\u2019s happening in a given fight, resulting in\u2026 The core gameplay loop, which consists of: buffing, quicksaving, walking into an encounter, reloading till we won, long resting, buffing, quicksaving, repeat ad nauseam for every fight in a dungeon, which there are a lot of. As we got higher level, there were more buffs to apply, fights required more reloading and everything took longer. The price to pay for 9th-level spells I guess. The difficulty and our lack of will to engage with the mechanics in-depth resulted in lots of savescumming, and relying on cheesy tactics such as pulling enemies from off-screen and spike traps, the ultimate trap that bypasses any resist. Special extra paragraph for everything else I hated: anything that removed all our buffs (beholders and certain bosses just having a \u201cRemove Magic\u201d move), magic resist, protection from magic weapons, regeneration, mislead, trap detection taking longer than 5s, \u201cyou can\u2019t open this lock for reasons\u201d, time stop for wasting our time, enemies reapplying buffs at half and 1/3rd hp through contingency, and every debuff spell lasting 3 real-life minutes. Story. The story\u2019s decent. It\u2019s easy to see most of the twists coming, and there\u2019s definitely a dated feeling to the main story. It felt like a D&D campaign you\u2019d play at home, which is a good thing. I think the real strength of the story came from all the side stories peppered throughout the world. Oh and the game tries to make you care for your adopted sister Imogen, screw you Imogen no one cares about your problems. Vibes. Wow, I\u2019ve written a lot of negative points about the game. I must really hate it. Wrong! As you can see from the score, I quite like the game. There\u2019s an inherent joy in playing the adult version of fantasy make-believe, and Baldur\u2019s Gate captures the tabletop feel better than most. The wide pool of systems and mechanics, environments and characters all come together into a sum greater than its parts. It\u2019s hard to point to one specific thing BG does right and say \u201cthat\u2019s why this is a good game\u201d, so I\u2019ll just list a few. A veritable deluge of characters, many of which had enough personality to stand out, even if we only spoke to them for a few, brief moments. They made the game feel like I imagine the Forgotten Realms. Good dialogue options and good writing. It\u2019s Bioware at its finest, which is to say most of the time, your roleplay can be represented by the options you pick. Vibing music. The intro screen song alone should be enough to convince you this game has a good soundtrack, and I\u2019m really sad it\u2019s not on Spotify so I can\u2019t use it for my own D&D games. A mountain of quests. I mentioned how the game brings you from zero to hero, well that includes a huge variety of quests. Investigate serial killings in the city, save a king from a troll invasion, banish a shadow lord from the forests, unmask a doppelganger conspiracy and so on. Finally, a complete character journey in any way you want it: control a party of 6 or play solo; pick mage, thief, fighter, druid, cleric, etc. with about 30 specializations. Multiclass or dual class (that\u2019s leveling 2 classes simultaneously on one character). Learn every spell in the game, cast Wish or Meteor Shower, contingency all the best defensive spells. As a fighter, hit enemies 12 times a turn with Greater Whirlwind, or click a button to only crit for a round. It\u2019s the kind of game that begs to be replayed and have its mechanics explored in detail. Overall, my personal experience with this game is a 10/10 because of my shared playthrough with William. His character voices and our lambasting of the plot made the experience all the more enjoyable, and I have to credit the game for having a decently well set-up online multiplayer. As a game that stands on its own, however, I give it a final score of 8/10.","title":"Baldur's Gate 2"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#baldurs-gate-1-2-throne-of-bhaal","text":"","title":"Baldur\u2019s Gate 1, 2 &amp; Throne of Bhaal"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#playtime-90-hours","text":"An epic high fantasy adventure that does something no other game has really done since: deliver a lvl 1 to 20+ D&D adventure.

Story. The story\u2019s actually fun! Book 1 is my favorite because it embodies the old school AdventureQuest feel of meta jokes, tons of puns and black-and-white characters. The villains are evil and bent on world domination, and the good guys are trying to stop them. It\u2019s refreshingly straightforward. In direct contrast, Book 3 covers themes like the horrors of war, the line between revolution and terrorism, and the evils of magic. I didn\u2019t like it as much at first, but it improved later in the story when we find out that one side is being manipulated by, you guessed it, a great evil bent on world domination. Leveling. Leveling feels good. It\u2019s fast enough, and class skills aren\u2019t tied to level, instead they\u2019re leveled separately by doing class quests and wearing the class\u2019 armor. I like this system, because it gives great flexibility in trying out multiple classes and switching whenever you feel like it. The only minus is that the ability to \u201csave\u201d your armor, aka be wearing it when you log in, is locked behind a real money item. Luckily I had just enough coins leftover from my purchase of the Dragon Amulet pack to afford it. Loot. This game has weird loot rules. Every quest will give you a piece of gear, but the gear\u2019s level is random and isn\u2019t constrained by your character level. You can get a lvl 74 sword at level 5, or a level 26 belt at level 50. At first I kept higher-level items, but then I realized I got so many it was useless and the only items worth keeping were those near my level. Combat. The combat\u2019s actually decent! There\u2019s an elemental weakness and resists system that promotes switching up your weapon, which you can do for free. Every class has a unique gameplay style, my favorites were Death Knight\u2019s life drain and life sacrifice style and Ninja\u2019s ambush crits and poison buildup. Problems. The UX just killed me sometimes. First off, they created a neat timeline of quests so you can easily catch up to the current story without getting lost.

Gameplay. The most important aspect of an arpg, the gameplay is divided into two main aspects: Planning and experimenting with builds, and killing monsters with the build. In the planning and experimenting department, Grim Dawn does very well, boasting a wide swath of gameplay styles and potential builds thanks to its dual class system (essentially, you pick two classes to play and can level them both up together). On top of that, refunding skill points is pretty cheap, making experimentation easy. Refunding attribute points is a lil tougher which is annoying and feels like an unnecessary blocker, but luckily you rarely have to change your attributes. When it comes to killing monsters, I find that it falls a bit behind its peers due to a lack of oomph in most skill animations, and a colour palette that\u2019s a little too monochromatic makes enemies and environments blend together. The mechanical balance of the game is, however, quite good, and a well-built character will make enemies go splat at a satisfying speed. Grind. Once you get to lategame, my usual complaints for arpgs crop up. The grind is much too long, and once again cool items and sets are locked behind arbitrary drop rates. I get that some people like spending hundreds of hours and making dozens of characters just to get one character kitted out in top tier gear, but I\u2019d really enjoy it if these games introduced a \u201cdad with no free time\u201d mode for singleplayer that tweaks drop rates. As it stands, even with a mod increasing drop rates by 12x, I had trouble finding decent items. Something that particularly irked me is that all the cool uniques and all sets are global random drops, meaning there\u2019s no specific boss or spot you can farm for an item; you just have to play more of the game. I prefer the goal-oriented style of Diablo 2 where I farmed a boss looking for an item drop. My one complaint about the build system is that gear affixes, aka the components and augments you stick on your gear, had way too much importance. In the endgame, they were as important as the full set of purple gear you\u2019d be wearing. Trying to go without them or with too weak versions would spell certain death. Because they\u2019re affixes and not gear pieces themselves, and because they need to be crafted from recipes and aren\u2019t found as drops, I found them lame and annoying and they didn\u2019t give a feeling of excitement or coolness when you finally crafted that top level component. The difficulty curve is actually quite good, with the usual 3 tiers of normal, veteran and ultimate. Other than the gear affix system getting in the way of a smooth leveling curve, my only (minor) complaint is that you\u2019ll find the usual arpg problem on ultimate difficulty of getting instagibbed and not knowing wtf happened until you look up the creature on the game\u2019s wiki and realize you\u2019re missing 10% poison resistance or something. Art. I mentioned it briefly, but the art in Grim Dawn doesn\u2019t stand up to the likes of Diablo, even Diablo 2. The enemy and zone designs just aren\u2019t as interesting, and the animations are serviceable. Overall the art wasn\u2019t so terrible it was a detriment, but it didn\u2019t augment the experience. Story. There\u2019s an effort to have a story, which I\u2019d even call a step above other arpgs, but it still falls short of being interesting. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Grim Dawn. It scratched the itch for an arpg and its core gameplay was solid enough for me to play through all 3 difficulties and make a few different characters to try out fun builds. It doesn\u2019t do anything to innovate and it falls into most of the usual pitfalls, but it\u2019s still a solid entry into the genre. I\u2019d like to give a special shout out to the achievements for being well spaced out, motivating me to play a little more each time to get that next rare achievement.","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#grim-dawn","text":"","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#score-7510","text":"","title":"Score: 7.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#playtime-54-hours","text":"An isometric action RPG that fancies itself as a contender for the throne against rivals Diablo and Path of Exile, Grim Dawn does a lot right by the player while leaving some aspects less polished.

Gameplay. You play as spacefaring rebels with a smattering of traits that may increase difficulty, and you complete missions of various types to build up a bar to free a space station. Free enough stations and you can liberate a stronghold, liberate four strongholds and you\u2019ve won the game! There\u2019s a lot of mission variety to be had. All of them involve docking at an enemy spaceship, but their goals and methods differ: you may have to rescue, assassinate or knock out someone; steal a treasure or steal the ship; crash the ship, or simply kill everyone aboard. You may have to never be spotted, or never trigger an alarm, or finish the mission in 60 seconds or less (from the time you accept it, not from the time you dock. Gotta move fast!). There are difficulties ranging from easy to mistake and glory. Harder difficulties mean more enemies, bigger maps and more constraints and caveats. As you play and get better, you\u2019ll find yourself only playing the harder missions for bigger rewards and bigger thrills. There\u2019s a lot of enemy variety, from grunts to armored grunts; guys with heat sensors that can detect you through walls or jammers that can stop your gear from working; trackers that can follow your footsteps or deadly predators that can instantly teleport backstab you from their mile-wide sensor radius.

Each has its own short cooldown between uses, but you can freely swap between them to take out rooms of guards in an instant. Overall, the combination of constraints and the huge number of ways you can approach a mission make this game a blast to play, and the straightforward progression of liberating stations keeps it from overstaying its welcome.

Gameplay. Dig, explore, slay monsters and bosses, tinker and unlock cool stuff, interact with NPC vendors and uncover all kinds of secrets, all with your friends. It\u2019s the type of game I enjoy playing, as each new thing keeps me excited to find more and discover what\u2019s under the next rock. Talking mechanics, the combat is not great (still better than Valheim\u2019s). The fun part of combat is trying out crazy and kooky new weapons, of which there are a ton. The not so fun part is that boss fights seem to go in the dark souls, even bullet hell direction of tons of lasers and bullets you have to dodge, except the controls aren\u2019t conducive to dodging in that way. Instead, boss fights would entail smacking the boss, chugging potions, and moving in a random pattern hoping you\u2019d get hit less that way; essentially devolving into more of a gear check than any kind of skill expression. Digging and exploration, however, felt great. Zones had an appropriate amount of danger to keep you on your toes, and unique mobs, blocks and treasure were available in every biome. Finding the lava biome at the bottom of the world, or the houses in the clouds, had a real sense of wonder, which I think is the best marker of success for an exploration sandbox game. It felt like the devs were constantly daring you to try new things, promising that there\u2019d be a secret behind every corner. UI. When the official wiki is practically required to play the game, your UI\u2019s lacking. On top of that, the core mechanic that is crafting is poorly implemented, with a weird vertical or horizontal single line scrolling menu with only tiny icons and names. It\u2019s clear the devs don\u2019t have a UI designer or programmer, and I think the game could be greatly improved by hiring one. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind too much since I\u2019m fine using a second monitor to look things up. The wiki\u2019s even linked from the game\u2019s main menu, but all that info should really just be in the game. Information could even be gamified, like in-game hints on how to summon the Wall of Flesh instead of a vague description text on a voodoo doll that definitely doesn\u2019t say you should throw it in lava. Progression. One of the most fun parts of Terraria is how the game quickly builds up from \u201cguy with a pickaxe and some dirt blocks\u201d to having 5 different types of armor, a bunch of crafting stations, magic spells, and being able to fly. The progression flows well, as each boss drops the item required to craft a new station or a new type of ingot, or a key to a new zone. Unlocking hardmode was a thrill, as a huge explosion of new stuff was suddenly at your fingertips all at once, with tougher monsters everywhere. All of a sudden you could visit the sky, a secret temple in the depths of the jungle and a whole new corruption biome. Art. The art is serviceable, sometimes even cute in a pixelated way. Minor complaint is that there can be too many things on screen, making it hard to see a boss in the middle of a sea of lasers, or a crafting station in the middle of the mess that was our base. Overall, Terraria succeeds in being a fun exploration romp with friends, while having a couple of areas, namely combat and the UI/progression, where it could use improvement. For that reason, I award it a solid 8/10 fun game score.","title":"Terraria"},{"location":"reviews/terraria/#terraria","text":"","title":"Terraria"},{"location":"reviews/terraria/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/terraria/#playtime-102-hours","text":"A sandbox rpg that\u2019s kinda like 2D Minecraft (in the digging blocks and building things sense), kinda like 2D Valheim (in the fighting bosses and unlocking new tiers of gear and crafting stations sense).Terraria is a game that\u2019s well-loved by its devs, and it shows.

It\u2019s clear the devs don\u2019t have a UI designer or programmer, and I think the game could be greatly improved by hiring one. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind too much since I\u2019m fine using a second monitor to look things up. The wiki\u2019s even linked from the game\u2019s main menu, but all that info should really just be in the game. Information could even be gamified, like in-game hints on how to summon the Wall of Flesh instead of a vague description text on a voodoo doll that definitely doesn\u2019t say you should throw it in lava. Progression. One of the most fun parts of Terraria is how the game quickly builds up from \u201cguy with a pickaxe and some dirt blocks\u201d to having 5 different types of armor, a bunch of crafting stations, magic spells, and being able to fly. The progression flows well, as each boss drops the item required to craft a new station or a new type of ingot, or a key to a new zone. Unlocking hardmode was a thrill, as a huge explosion of new stuff was suddenly at your fingertips all at once, with tougher monsters everywhere. All of a sudden you could visit the sky, a secret temple in the depths of the jungle and a whole new corruption biome. Art. The art is serviceable, sometimes even cute in a pixelated way. Minor complaint is that there can be too many things on screen, making it hard to see a boss in the middle of a sea of lasers, or a crafting station in the middle of the mess that was our base. Overall, Terraria succeeds in being a fun exploration romp with friends, while having a couple of areas, namely combat and the UI/progression, where it could use improvement. For that reason, I award it a solid 8/10 fun game score.","title":"Playtime: 102 hours"},{"location":"reviews/vampiresurvivors/","text":"Vampire Survivors Score: 10/10 Playtime: 86 hours, 100% achievements A flawless performance of finding out how high you can go; the game pulls new tricks out of its coffin every time you think you\u2019ve peaked. Gameplay. It\u2019s simple you see. You start with a couple guys, you kill some mobs moving towards you and grab some xp gems. You level up and pick a new weapon that shoots things every so often. You die at minute 11, damn. Too many mobs to deal with. But lo! If you have the right support item and your weapon\u2019s maxed out, it transforms into a better weapon. That\u2019s so cool, you think as you mow down legions of mobs and get past minute 11. What other combinations unlock new weapons? So begins an adventure whence your character will reach untold power with the strength of many evolved weapons. Of course runs always end at minute 30 when Red Death spawns and instakills you. Or\u2026 could there be a way of killing Death itself? An item built from things picked up around certain maps, granting you i-frames galore and another freezing enemies and halving their health? But what about Blue, Green, Pink, Gold Deaths? What if they combined together into a mechazord, how would you fight that? And that\u2019s only the base game! Once you get into the DLCs, you\u2019ll find quests for items, challenge runs to unlock special characters with OP abilities, and a swathe of new weapons and ways to evolve them that\u2019ll make your brain shoot happy chemicals as you weave between mobs and watch numbers go up. Eventually, you may even learn the forbidden knowledge of infinite scaling runs, infinite gold and infinite stat boosts. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve truly beaten Vampire Survivors, and the best part is, all of it is intended by the devs. There\u2019s achievements for every goal you meet, every secret you find. From a technical standpoint, this game is pretty impressive as well. The only time I\u2019ve ever seen it lag is during hour 6 of my infinite scaling run, when the number of mobs and particle effects had likely reached well into the tens of thousands.","title":"Vampire Survivors"},{"location":"reviews/vampiresurvivors/#vampire-survivors","text":"","title":"Vampire Survivors"},{"location":"reviews/vampiresurvivors/#score-1010","text":"","title":"Score: 10/10"},{"location":"reviews/vampiresurvivors/#playtime-86-hours-100-achievements","text":"A flawless performance of finding out how high you can go; the game pulls new tricks out of its coffin every time you think you\u2019ve peaked.

Gameplay. As long as you know the rts genre, you know what\u2019s going on here. In the main campaign, you control the Blood Ravens as they mow down hordes of orks, chaos abominations and one eldar. The key difference from other rts is the capture points; maps are covered with capture the flag style points that generate your primary resource. Most missions involve balancing research and production with expansion and consolidation of your control points as you fend off enemy forays. At least, until you amass a deathball or a couple of Terminators or Land Raiders and roll over everything. Art. The art is serviceable, certainly moreso than Starcraft 1. It\u2019s in that sweet spot of old games where everything\u2019s pixelated, but you can still clearly see what models look like. At a glance, the Blood Raven units all look similar. They have red troopers and red vehicles. But after commanding them for a while, you learn to love the quirks of each unit type. This is greatly helped by the audio lines, which nail the oldschool rts feel of repeatability, meme-ability and love-ability. Quotes in the Terminator\u2019s badass deep voices like \u201cA moment of laxity spawns a lifetime of heresy\u201d, or the Land Raider\u2019s radio voice saying \u201cDeath has arrived\u201d. Combat is full of shouts and screams, my favorite being chaos cultists shouting \u201cMY SPLEEN\u201d when they blow up. Story. Believe it or not, the story\u2019s actually decent. You control Captain Gabriel Angelos and his Blood Ravens 3rd company as they repel an ork invasion and investigate signs of chaos incursion on the planet Tartarus. The story hits all the warhammer 40k beats: suspicion, corruption and betrayal battle against faith in the Emperor in our beloved captain. The cutscenes wouldn\u2019t be anything special if it weren\u2019t for the stellar voice acting. The cast gives it 110%, especially the villains, delivering the most bombastic and over-the-top performances they had no right to in an rts, which complements warhammer\u2019s feel perfectly. Overall, Dawn of War stands out as an excellent example of the golden age of rts, and acts as a most enjoyable portal into the world of 40k. I like the Blood Ravens now, and I hope the DLCs will make me like the other factions just as much.","title":"WH40K: Dawn of War"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#wh40k-dawn-of-war","text":"","title":"WH40K: Dawn of War"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#playtime-12-hours","text":"An oldschool rts crafted with love and attention to the lore, Dawn of War has everything I look for when I think \u201cgame like Starcraft 1 but a tiny bit more recent\u201d.
