<p>An epic high fantasy adventure that does something no other game has really done since: deliver a lvl 1 to 20+ D&amp;D adventure. Go from zero to god-slaying hero, from 6hp mage with magic missile to picking epic-level feats like Summon Planetar and the legendary Spike Trap. Throughout this review, I’ll refer to both games and the DLC as one game, as they follow seamlessly from one to the other, including a character import feature that Bioware would later use in Mass Effect!</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay and Combat.</strong> I have to start with the part that grinds my gears the hardest, and is responsible for the 2 points off this game’s total score. Baldur’s Gate uses a complete adaptation of D&amp;D’s 2nd edition ruleset, which includes a lot of mechanics we aren’t used to like THAC0 (lower AC is better) and % based magic resist. The overall gameplay loop is what you’d expect from a crpg: you talk to people in town, go questing in dungeons or crypts or sewers, and collect loot after bad mouthing the boss for walking into your legion of spike traps. But before we talk about what Baldur’s Gate does right, let’s talk about what it does terribly wrong. I’ve identified three main issues with the gameplay: encounter balance, clarity of information and the core gameplay loop…</p>
<p>Honestly something I’ve seen in all crpgs I’ve played is horrendous encounter balance. Some are minor offenders, like BG3 and Divinity 2, and some are horrible like Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous.. The devs’ philosophy seems to be “players can reload so we should make fights as hard as possible”, and BG1&amp;2 is definitely guilty of this. The game too often makes use of the classic cutscene-into-combat technique which leaves you without buffs or traps and with bad positioning. Dungeons are filled with inexplicable groups of dozens of mind flayers/beholders/what-have-you, and most immersion-shattering of all are the groups of random humans who can go toe-to-toe with our godlings, such as the infamous sewer adventurers who had no relation to the plot but just happened to be a full party of lvl 16+ characters capable of casting Time Stop and other great spells. This made us constantly wary of any foe we went up against, which leads me to my second point…</p>
<p><strong>Clarity of information.</strong> It’s hard, nay impossible to know if Zorl the cleric and Tarnor the fighter are going to be a walk in the park or a nightmare of an encounter until you engage them and you either steamroll them or die in 6 seconds. This got worse with levels, as trying to fight without your buffs up resulted in very fast deaths. On top of that, since the game includes every spell in the cleric and wizard book plus monster abilities, there’s a lot to know. And none of that information is presented upfront; you have to check your own spellbook or look it up online. Fights wouldn’t be so terrible, if it weren’t for the fact that it’s often prohibitively difficult to see what’s going on because the combat log scrolls back to the bottom every time something new happens. Often so many things happen at once that the chat is completely overloaded. For example, it became common for enemies to initiate combat with multiple buffs applied through spell chaining (I guess they’re all high level mages), so the start of a fight would have no less than 30 to 60 lines of messages. Try scrolling through that to find the one important line where they cast Protection from Magical Weapons, Stoneskin or Spell Reflection. This resulted in us essentially giving up on finding out what’s happening in a given fight, resulting in…</p>
<p>The core gameplay loop, which consists of: buffing, quicksaving, walking into an encounter, reloading till we won, long resting, buffing, quicksaving, repeat ad nauseam for every fight in a dungeon, which there are a lot of. As we got higher level, there were more buffs to apply, fights required more reloading and everything took longer. The price to pay for 9th-level spells I guess. The difficulty and our lack of will to engage with the mechanics in-depth resulted in lots of savescumming, and relying on cheesy tactics such as pulling enemies from off-screen and spike traps, the ultimate trap that bypasses any resist. </p>
<p>Special extra paragraph for everything else I hated: anything that removed all our buffs (beholders and certain bosses just having a “Remove Magic” move), magic resist, protection from magic weapons, regeneration, mislead, trap detection taking longer than 5s, “you can’t open this lock for reasons”, time stop for wasting our time, enemies reapplying buffs at half and 1/3rd hp through contingency, and every debuff spell lasting 3 real-life minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Story.</strong>  The story’s decent. It’s easy to see most of the twists coming, and there’s definitely a dated feeling to the main story. It felt like a D&amp;D campaign you’d play at home, which is a good thing. I think the real strength of the story came from all the side stories peppered throughout the world. Oh and the game tries to make you care for your adopted sister Imogen, screw you Imogen no one cares about your problems.</p>
<p><strong>Vibes.</strong> Wow, I’ve written a lot of negative points about the game. I must really hate it. Wrong! As you can see from the score, I quite like the game. There’s an inherent joy in playing the adult version of fantasy make-believe, and Baldur’s Gate captures the tabletop feel better than most. The wide pool of systems and mechanics, environments and characters all come together into a sum greater than its parts. It’s hard to point to one specific thing BG does right and say “that’s why this is a good game”, so I’ll just list a few. A veritable deluge of characters, many of which had enough personality to stand out, even if we only spoke to them for a few, brief moments. They made the game feel like I imagine the Forgotten Realms. Good dialogue options and good writing. It’s Bioware at its finest, which is to say most of the time, your roleplay can be represented by the options you pick. Vibing music. The intro screen song alone should be enough to convince you this game has a good soundtrack, and I’m really sad it’s not on Spotify so I can’t use it for my own D&amp;D games. A mountain of quests. I mentioned how the game brings you from zero to hero, well that includes a huge variety of quests. Investigate serial killings in the city, save a king from a troll invasion, banish a shadow lord from the forests, unmask a doppelganger conspiracy and so on. Finally, a complete character journey in any way you want it: control a party of 6 or play solo; pick mage, thief, fighter, druid, cleric, etc. with about 30 specializations. Multiclass or dual class (that’s leveling 2 classes simultaneously on one character). Learn every spell in the game, cast Wish or Meteor Shower, contingency all the best defensive spells. As a fighter, hit enemies 12 times a turn with Greater Whirlwind, or click a button to only crit for a round. It’s the kind of game that begs to be replayed and have its mechanics explored in detail.</p>
<p>Overall, my personal experience with this game is a 10/10 because of my shared playthrough with William. His character voices and our lambasting of the plot made the experience all the more enjoyable, and I have to credit the game for having a decently well set-up online multiplayer. As a game that stands on its own, however, I give it a final score of 8/10.</p></p>
