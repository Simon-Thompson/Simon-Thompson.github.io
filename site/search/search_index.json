Go from zero to god-slaying hero, from 6hp mage with magic missile to picking epic-level feats like Summon Planetar and the legendary Spike Trap. Throughout this review, I\u2019ll refer to both games and the DLC as one game, as they follow seamlessly from one to the other, including a character import feature that Bioware would later use in Mass Effect! Gameplay and Combat. I have to start with the part that grinds my gears the hardest, and is responsible for the 2 points off this game\u2019s total score. Baldur\u2019s Gate uses a complete adaptation of D&D\u2019s 2nd edition ruleset, which includes a lot of mechanics we aren\u2019t used to like THAC0 (lower AC is better) and % based magic resist. The overall gameplay loop is what you\u2019d expect from a crpg: you talk to people in town, go questing in dungeons or crypts or sewers, and collect loot after bad mouthing the boss for walking into your legion of spike traps. But before we talk about what Baldur\u2019s Gate does right, let\u2019s talk about what it does terribly wrong. I\u2019ve identified three main issues with the gameplay: encounter balance, clarity of information and the core gameplay loop\u2026 Honestly something I\u2019ve seen in all crpgs I\u2019ve played is horrendous encounter balance. Some are minor offenders, like BG3 and Divinity 2, and some are horrible like Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous.. The devs\u2019 philosophy seems to be \u201cplayers can reload so we should make fights as hard as possible\u201d, and BG1&2 is definitely guilty of this. The game too often makes use of the classic cutscene-into-combat technique which leaves you without buffs or traps and with bad positioning. Dungeons are filled with inexplicable groups of dozens of mind flayers/beholders/what-have-you, and most immersion-shattering of all are the groups of random humans who can go toe-to-toe with our godlings, such as the infamous sewer adventurers who had no relation to the plot but just happened to be a full party of lvl 16+ characters capable of casting Time Stop and other great spells. This made us constantly wary of any foe we went up against, which leads me to my second point\u2026 Clarity of information. It\u2019s hard, nay impossible to know if Zorl the cleric and Tarnor the fighter are going to be a walk in the park or a nightmare of an encounter until you engage them and you either steamroll them or die in 6 seconds. This got worse with levels, as trying to fight without your buffs up resulted in very fast deaths. On top of that, since the game includes every spell in the cleric and wizard book plus monster abilities, there\u2019s a lot to know. And none of that information is presented upfront; you have to check your own spellbook or look it up online. Fights wouldn\u2019t be so terrible, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it\u2019s often prohibitively difficult to see what\u2019s going on because the combat log scrolls back to the bottom every time something new happens. Often so many things happen at once that the chat is completely overloaded. For example, it became common for enemies to initiate combat with multiple buffs applied through spell chaining (I guess they\u2019re all high level mages), so the start of a fight would have no less than 30 to 60 lines of messages. Try scrolling through that to find the one important line where they cast Protection from Magical Weapons, Stoneskin or Spell Reflection. This resulted in us essentially giving up on finding out what\u2019s happening in a given fight, resulting in\u2026 The core gameplay loop, which consists of: buffing, quicksaving, walking into an encounter, reloading till we won, long resting, buffing, quicksaving, repeat ad nauseam for every fight in a dungeon, which there are a lot of. As we got higher level, there were more buffs to apply, fights required more reloading and everything took longer. The price to pay for 9th-level spells I guess. The difficulty and our lack of will to engage with the mechanics in-depth resulted in lots of savescumming, and relying on cheesy tactics such as pulling enemies from off-screen and spike traps, the ultimate trap that bypasses any resist. Special extra paragraph for everything else I hated: anything that removed all our buffs (beholders and certain bosses just having a \u201cRemove Magic\u201d move), magic resist, protection from magic weapons, regeneration, mislead, trap detection taking longer than 5s, \u201cyou can\u2019t open this lock for reasons\u201d, time stop for wasting our time, enemies reapplying buffs at half and 1/3rd hp through contingency, and every debuff spell lasting 3 real-life minutes. Story. The story\u2019s decent. It\u2019s easy to see most of the twists coming, and there\u2019s definitely a dated feeling to the main story. It felt like a D&D campaign you\u2019d play at home, which is a good thing. I think the real strength of the story came from all the side stories peppered throughout the world. Oh and the game tries to make you care for your adopted sister Imogen, screw you Imogen no one cares about your problems. Vibes. Wow, I\u2019ve written a lot of negative points about the game. I must really hate it. Wrong! As you can see from the score, I quite like the game. There\u2019s an inherent joy in playing the adult version of fantasy make-believe, and Baldur\u2019s Gate captures the tabletop feel better than most. The wide pool of systems and mechanics, environments and characters all come together into a sum greater than its parts. It\u2019s hard to point to one specific thing BG does right and say \u201cthat\u2019s why this is a good game\u201d, so I\u2019ll just list a few. A veritable deluge of characters, many of which had enough personality to stand out, even if we only spoke to them for a few, brief moments. They made the game feel like I imagine the Forgotten Realms. Good dialogue options and good writing. It\u2019s Bioware at its finest, which is to say most of the time, your roleplay can be represented by the options you pick. Vibing music. The intro screen song alone should be enough to convince you this game has a good soundtrack, and I\u2019m really sad it\u2019s not on Spotify so I can\u2019t use it for my own D&D games. A mountain of quests. I mentioned how the game brings you from zero to hero, well that includes a huge variety of quests. Investigate serial killings in the city, save a king from a troll invasion, banish a shadow lord from the forests, unmask a doppelganger conspiracy and so on. Finally, a complete character journey in any way you want it: control a party of 6 or play solo; pick mage, thief, fighter, druid, cleric, etc. with about 30 specializations. Multiclass or dual class (that\u2019s leveling 2 classes simultaneously on one character). Learn every spell in the game, cast Wish or Meteor Shower, contingency all the best defensive spells. As a fighter, hit enemies 12 times a turn with Greater Whirlwind, or click a button to only crit for a round. It\u2019s the kind of game that begs to be replayed and have its mechanics explored in detail. Overall, my personal experience with this game is a 10/10 because of my shared playthrough with William. His character voices and our lambasting of the plot made the experience all the more enjoyable, and I have to credit the game for having a decently well set-up online multiplayer. As a game that stands on its own, however, I give it a final score of 8/10.","title":"Baldur's Gate 2"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#baldurs-gate-1-2-throne-of-bhaal","text":"","title":"Baldur\u2019s Gate 1, 2 &amp; Throne of Bhaal"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/baldursgate/#playtime-90-hours","text":"An epic high fantasy adventure that does something no other game has really done since: deliver a lvl 1 to 20+ D&D adventure.

Gameplay. The most important aspect of an arpg, the gameplay is divided into two main aspects: Planning and experimenting with builds, and killing monsters with the build. In the planning and experimenting department, Grim Dawn does very well, boasting a wide swath of gameplay styles and potential builds thanks to its dual class system (essentially, you pick two classes to play and can level them both up together). On top of that, refunding skill points is pretty cheap, making experimentation easy. Refunding attribute points is a lil tougher which is annoying and feels like an unnecessary blocker, but luckily you rarely have to change your attributes. When it comes to killing monsters, I find that it falls a bit behind its peers due to a lack of oomph in most skill animations, and a colour palette that\u2019s a little too monochromatic makes enemies and environments blend together. The mechanical balance of the game is, however, quite good, and a well-built character will make enemies go splat at a satisfying speed. Grind. Once you get to lategame, my usual complaints for arpgs crop up. The grind is much too long, and once again cool items and sets are locked behind arbitrary drop rates. I get that some people like spending hundreds of hours and making dozens of characters just to get one character kitted out in top tier gear, but I\u2019d really enjoy it if these games introduced a \u201cdad with no free time\u201d mode for singleplayer that tweaks drop rates. As it stands, even with a mod increasing drop rates by 12x, I had trouble finding decent items. Something that particularly irked me is that all the cool uniques and all sets are global random drops, meaning there\u2019s no specific boss or spot you can farm for an item; you just have to play more of the game. I prefer the goal-oriented style of Diablo 2 where I farmed a boss looking for an item drop. My one complaint about the build system is that gear affixes, aka the components and augments you stick on your gear, had way too much importance. In the endgame, they were as important as the full set of purple gear you\u2019d be wearing. Trying to go without them or with too weak versions would spell certain death. Because they\u2019re affixes and not gear pieces themselves, and because they need to be crafted from recipes and aren\u2019t found as drops, I found them lame and annoying and they didn\u2019t give a feeling of excitement or coolness when you finally crafted that top level component. The difficulty curve is actually quite good, with the usual 3 tiers of normal, veteran and ultimate. Other than the gear affix system getting in the way of a smooth leveling curve, my only (minor) complaint is that you\u2019ll find the usual arpg problem on ultimate difficulty of getting instagibbed and not knowing wtf happened until you look up the creature on the game\u2019s wiki and realize you\u2019re missing 10% poison resistance or something. Art. I mentioned it briefly, but the art in Grim Dawn doesn\u2019t stand up to the likes of Diablo, even Diablo 2. The enemy and zone designs just aren\u2019t as interesting, and the animations are serviceable. Overall the art wasn\u2019t so terrible it was a detriment, but it didn\u2019t augment the experience. Story. There\u2019s an effort to have a story, which I\u2019d even call a step above other arpgs, but it still falls short of being interesting. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Grim Dawn. It scratched the itch for an arpg and its core gameplay was solid enough for me to play through all 3 difficulties and make a few different characters to try out fun builds. It doesn\u2019t do anything to innovate and it falls into most of the usual pitfalls, but it\u2019s still a solid entry into the genre. I\u2019d like to give a special shout out to the achievements for being well spaced out, motivating me to play a little more each time to get that next rare achievement.","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#grim-dawn","text":"","title":"Grim Dawn"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#score-7510","text":"","title":"Score: 7.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/grimdawn/#playtime-54-hours","text":"An isometric action RPG that fancies itself as a contender for the throne against rivals Diablo and Path of Exile, Grim Dawn does a lot right by the player while leaving some aspects less polished.

I\u2019d like to give a special shout out to the achievements for being well spaced out, motivating me to play a little more each time to get that next rare achievement.","title":"Playtime: 54 hours"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/","text":"Hi Fi Rush Score: 10/10 Playtime: 12 hours A rhythm-based action game that\u2019s as cheesy as it is endearing. The combat, the writing and the pacing were all hits. Story. The writing\u2019s fun, bringing a lot of humour and levity in a cheesy, tongue-in-cheek kind of way. It never overstays its welcome and blends perfectly with the game\u2019s look and feel. Graphics. Feel the beat! Everything in the game, from the environment to the enemies to your character\u2019s animations whether he\u2019s idling, moving or fighting, follows the beat of the level\u2019s music. The whole game tries to support you in staying on the beat. The cartoony style the devs chose is cleanly realized and works well with the game\u2019s tone. Occasionally during boss fights and cutscenes, they\u2019ll bring out alternate art styles for single frames, drawing inspiration from Borderlands for \u201cboss intro cards\u201d and Jojo\u2019s for silly poses and over-the-top shading. All of it works together to deliver an experience that\u2019s a feast for the eyes. Combat. Combos! Moves galore! While the combat might stand up to combo brawler giants Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, it certainly doesn\u2019t slack. There\u2019s nothing I can fault it for, and the rhythm system makes it stand on its own, able to provide a fun experience different from its counterparts. My biggest plus is that the game is newbie friendly, and you can beat it while being terrible at keeping to the beat, although your scores might be abysmal because of it. S-rank score, S-rank clear time, C-rank Just Timing :yea: For those that aren\u2019t musically crippled, there\u2019s a challenge mode and mission achievements to aim for that look like a good time! Overall, Hi Fi Rush is a success on all fronts. I loved the characters, the story, the gameplay, the graphics and the game\u2019s pacing and length were perfect.","title":"Hi Fi Rush"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#hi-fi-rush","text":"","title":"Hi Fi Rush"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#score-1010","text":"","title":"Score: 10/10"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#playtime-12-hours","text":"A rhythm-based action game that\u2019s as cheesy as it is endearing.

Gameplay. Dig, explore, slay monsters and bosses, tinker and unlock cool stuff, interact with NPC vendors and uncover all kinds of secrets, all with your friends. It\u2019s the type of game I enjoy playing, as each new thing keeps me excited to find more and discover what\u2019s under the next rock. Talking mechanics, the combat is not great (still better than Valheim\u2019s). The fun part of combat is trying out crazy and kooky new weapons, of which there are a ton. The not so fun part is that boss fights seem to go in the dark souls, even bullet hell direction of tons of lasers and bullets you have to dodge, except the controls aren\u2019t conducive to dodging in that way. Instead, boss fights would entail smacking the boss, chugging potions, and moving in a random pattern hoping you\u2019d get hit less that way; essentially devolving into more of a gear check than any kind of skill expression. Digging and exploration, however, felt great. Zones had an appropriate amount of danger to keep you on your toes, and unique mobs, blocks and treasure were available in every biome. Finding the lava biome at the bottom of the world, or the houses in the clouds, had a real sense of wonder, which I think is the best marker of success for an exploration sandbox game. It felt like the devs were constantly daring you to try new things, promising that there\u2019d be a secret behind every corner. UI. When the official wiki is practically required to play the game, your UI\u2019s lacking. On top of that, the core mechanic that is crafting is poorly implemented, with a weird vertical or horizontal single line scrolling menu with only tiny icons and names. It\u2019s clear the devs don\u2019t have a UI designer or programmer, and I think the game could be greatly improved by hiring one. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind too much since I\u2019m fine using a second monitor to look things up. The wiki\u2019s even linked from the game\u2019s main menu, but all that info should really just be in the game. Information could even be gamified, like in-game hints on how to summon the Wall of Flesh instead of a vague description text on a voodoo doll that definitely doesn\u2019t say you should throw it in lava. Progression. One of the most fun parts of Terraria is how the game quickly builds up from \u201cguy with a pickaxe and some dirt blocks\u201d to having 5 different types of armor, a bunch of crafting stations, magic spells, and being able to fly. The progression flows well, as each boss drops the item required to craft a new station or a new type of ingot, or a key to a new zone. Unlocking hardmode was a thrill, as a huge explosion of new stuff was suddenly at your fingertips all at once, with tougher monsters everywhere. All of a sudden you could visit the sky, a secret temple in the depths of the jungle and a whole new corruption biome. Art. The art is serviceable, sometimes even cute in a pixelated way. Minor complaint is that there can be too many things on screen, making it hard to see a boss in the middle of a sea of lasers, or a crafting station in the middle of the mess that was our base. Overall, Terraria succeeds in being a fun exploration romp with friends, while having a couple of areas, namely combat and the UI/progression, where it could use improvement. For that reason, I award it a solid 8/10 fun game score.","title":"Terraria"},{"location":"reviews/terraria/#terraria","text":"","title":"Terraria"},{"location":"reviews/terraria/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/terraria/#playtime-102-hours","text":"A sandbox rpg that\u2019s kinda like 2D Minecraft (in the digging blocks and building things sense), kinda like 2D Valheim (in the fighting bosses and unlocking new tiers of gear and crafting stations sense).Terraria is a game that\u2019s well-loved by its devs, and it shows.

Gameplay. As long as you know the rts genre, you know what\u2019s going on here. In the main campaign, you control the Blood Ravens as they mow down hordes of orks, chaos abominations and one eldar. The key difference from other rts is the capture points; maps are covered with capture the flag style points that generate your primary resource. Most missions involve balancing research and production with expansion and consolidation of your control points as you fend off enemy forays. At least, until you amass a deathball or a couple of Terminators or Land Raiders and roll over everything. Art. The art is serviceable, certainly moreso than Starcraft 1. It\u2019s in that sweet spot of old games where everything\u2019s pixelated, but you can still clearly see what models look like. At a glance, the Blood Raven units all look similar. They have red troopers and red vehicles. But after commanding them for a while, you learn to love the quirks of each unit type. This is greatly helped by the audio lines, which nail the oldschool rts feel of repeatability, meme-ability and love-ability. Quotes in the Terminator\u2019s badass deep voices like \u201cA moment of laxity spawns a lifetime of heresy\u201d, or the Land Raider\u2019s radio voice saying \u201cDeath has arrived\u201d. Combat is full of shouts and screams, my favorite being chaos cultists shouting \u201cMY SPLEEN\u201d when they blow up. Story. Believe it or not, the story\u2019s actually decent. You control Captain Gabriel Angelos and his Blood Ravens 3rd company as they repel an ork invasion and investigate signs of chaos incursion on the planet Tartarus. The story hits all the warhammer 40k beats: suspicion, corruption and betrayal battle against faith in the Emperor in our beloved captain. The cutscenes wouldn\u2019t be anything special if it weren\u2019t for the stellar voice acting. The cast gives it 110%, especially the villains, delivering the most bombastic and over-the-top performances they had no right to in an rts, which complements warhammer\u2019s feel perfectly. Overall, Dawn of War stands out as an excellent example of the golden age of rts, and acts as a most enjoyable portal into the world of 40k. I like the Blood Ravens now, and I hope the DLCs will make me like the other factions just as much.","title":"WH40K: Dawn of War"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#wh40k-dawn-of-war","text":"","title":"WH40K: Dawn of War"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/wh40kdawnofwar/#playtime-12-hours","text":"An oldschool rts crafted with love and attention to the lore, Dawn of War has everything I look for when I think \u201cgame like Starcraft 1 but a tiny bit more recent\u201d.
